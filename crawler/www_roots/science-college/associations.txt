Join a student group to enrich your student experience.The Concordia Undergraduate Journal of Art History (CUJAH) is aimed at showcasing the talents of the Art History Department’s undergraduate students. CUJAH serves as a published, academic forum for students’ research papers. The papers cover a broad range of art historical topics as taught by the department’s faculty.Concordia University’s Art History Graduate Student Association (AHGSA) endeavours to enhance the academic life of all graduate students involved in the study of art. Aside from promoting the research of students enrolled in the Art History, Humanities, and Special Individualized programs, AHGSA organizes social and academic events that foster dialogue and contribute to the development of its members’ graduate studies. AHGSA also provides a voice for its membership by sitting on various departmental committees.One of AHGSA’s principal activities is the organization of an annual graduate student conference. The two-day conference is usually held in mid-March and features a keynote speaker. Recent conferences include Shifting Borders, on the notion of borders within visual culture; Charged Circuits: Questioning International Exhibition Practices, on the proliferation of international exhibitions and their growing influence on the discipline of art history; and Writing between the Lines: Art and its Historians, on the roles, opportunities, and quandaries of those involved in writing art history.AHGSA is supported by Concordia’s Graduate Student Association and the Department of Art History.Established in 2012, the Indigenous Art Research Group promotes the study and engagement of Canadian Indigenous artistic practice. Our goal is to create space for discussions about current issues and triumphs of Indigenous artists and scholars. The group fosters this via panel discussions, exhibition curation, the production of a journal (Relations), and collaborations with student led and professional individuals and organizations. Of particular interest in the coming years is the development of long term relationships between the group and local Indigenous artists and arts communities. There are many ways for students to get involved; feel free to contact the group to inquire. Ethnocultural Art Histories Research (EAHR) is a 100% student-driven Working Group based at Concordia which seeks to increase the visibility and support of students and faculty from diverse cultural communities who are invested or interested in engaging with ethnocultural art histories research across various disciplines. Main activities might include guest lectures, exhibition visits and discussion groups.Yiara Magazine is an annual publication that discusses feminism in the context of art through visual and written material. We are a student-run magazine that aims to showcase students' work as well as promote critical thinking about the involvement of women in art. Our project includes an annual printed magazine, an exhibit as well as other events which aim to engage the Montreal community in explorations of the terms equality, femininity, motherhood, high/low art, power, etc. We understand art in all its diverse forms from visual to performance, literature and cinema without forgetting crafts of course. Similarly, we make room for the various notions of feminism, recognize their divergences and celebrate their commonalities. In cultivating a space for feminist dialogue in the field of art, we hope to pay tribute to women of the past and present, study the representation of femininity in the artistic sphere, raise questions in relation to the art historical canon and foray into the realm of gender exploration.Architecture ∣ Concordia encourages dialogue, criticism, reflection, and action in response to the history and current status of the built environment. as an inclusive research group we consist of undergraduates, graduates, alumni, and faculty. our mandate is to produce publications, events, and opportunities for different kinds of engagements with the diversity of architectural culture. we liaise with local partners and institutions, enabling architectural discovery outside the university. our experimental, annual publication serves as a platform for visual art, historical investigation and academic writing, and creative responses of all kinds to architecture.© Concordia UniversityAbout
