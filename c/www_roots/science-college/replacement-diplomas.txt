http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/graduation-convocation/students/diplomas/replacement-diplomas.htmlIf your diploma gets lost or destroyed, or if you legally change your name and would like it to appear on your diploma, you may request a replacement.There is a $100 (CDN) fee for this service.A replacement diploma is as equally valid and legal as the original diploma, but it is not identical to the original. The replacement diploma includes the phrase "replaces the original diploma issued to the recipient". It also includes the date that the replacement diploma was issued as well as the date that the original degree was conferred. Concordia keeps diplomas on file for three years, after which they will be destroyed.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityReplacement diplomasGraduation & convocation
