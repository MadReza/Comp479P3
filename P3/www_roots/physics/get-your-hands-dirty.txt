It provides students with complex, collaborative tasks and projects that test their conceptual knowledge against experience and situate their learning in real-world contexts.More hands-on opportunities for students complement and extend what happens in classrooms, providing transformative learning experiences that encourage students’ civic involvement and enhance their career readiness.directions@concordia.ca#CUdirections© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStrategic directions
