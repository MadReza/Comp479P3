These foods do not need to be kept hot or cold. Examples of lower risk foods:Although traditional bake sale foods such as bread, cakes, pies, cookies and candies rarely cause illness, it is important to remember that under the right circumstances any food can cause foodborne illness.Foods that can support the growth of pathogens and/or foods that have been associated with causing food borne illness. These foods must be kept and served hot or cold (i.e. dairies, meats). Examples of higher risk foods:Money is collected on-site as food is sold or food is not sold on site but money is collected through a registration, admission, donation fee to attend the event, and the money collected goes towards the cost of the event or the food being provid© Concordia UniversityAbout Food Services
