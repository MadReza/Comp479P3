http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2014/01/06/how-to-eat-smart-on-a-budget.htmlThe start of a new term is a time when many people resolve to adopt healthier behaviours, including eating better. This is a useful goal for anyone — including Concordians. The 2013 National College Health Assessment revealed that only 13 per cent of the university's students eat at least five servings of fruits or vegetables per day.It’s not enough to say, “I will eat healthier.” Plan for change, and approach it in a structured way to increase your chances of success.S.M.A.R.T. stands for Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic and Time-bound.Examples of S.M.A.R.T. healthy eating goals are:To commit to your goal, you need to see it as important and believe that you can achieve it.One way to build commitment is to tie your healthy eating goal to your values and other life goals. For example, if you place importance on financial stability and are a student who would like to graduate debt-free, preparing meals for yourself will help you keep those goals in line. Preparing food at home will also help you eat better because takeout foods are often less nutritious than what you make for yourself.Watch the video Tips for healthy eating on a budget to find out how to make good meals at home for less, and consult the How to Effectively Set, Achieve and Maintain Health Goals guide for several activities to help you build your commitment.Identify:Monitoring helps you stay on track — but you don’t need to count calories!If you achieved your goal, ask yourself: What helped? Keep doing it! If you didn’t achieve your goal that day, ask yourself: What obstacle did I encounter? What will I do differently tomorrow?A healthy diet is a plant-based diet. This means choosing fruit, vegetables and grains — mostly whole grains — more often. You can also choose protein-rich plant foods instead of meat. Plant foods that are a source of protein include beans, nuts and seeds.Canada’s Food Guide offers an overview of healthy eating and is a great place to start.It recommends:Healthy Eating: A Practical Guide is another helpful resource. Pick up a hard copy in the waiting room at Health Services or around campus. Health Services' website summarizes the basics of good eating. More tips and information are also available on Food Services' website.The choices we make are shaped by the choices that are available to us.Having easy access to fresh, affordable fruits and vegetables on campus could make it easier for you to make healthier food choices every day.
