The base amount to purchase this plan is $1300 per term. It can be topped up at any time.This amount is based on federal governmental rules and regulations for university student tax exempt meal plans. These stipulate that a meal plan must represent at least 10 meals per week, per semester (i.e. 13 weeks). The calculation is based on an average cost of $10 per meal.In accordance with the Retail Sales Act, the voluntary tax-exempt Saver Meal Plan such as the Semester Plan offered at the University, is term-specific and expires at the end of every term.Any funds remaining on the plan after the duration of the tax free status date (May 2, 2017), will carryover but will be taxable. These funds do not expire, and are only lost once the student is no longer considered a registered student at the University.
Cost: Increments of $25 Declining Balance Dollars Top up your meal plan or purchase an independant plan ($25 minimum)
