This premium can be invested in social, economic or environmental projects.Most Fairtrade certified products have a price floor, called the Fairtrade Minimum Price. This measure ensures a decent price and stability for farmers at times when market prices drop below a sustainable level.The Fairtrade Premium is often invested in better equipment and techniques.Through its locally-based liaison officers, Fairtrade International improves access to agricultural services such as organic trainings.The Fairtrade Premium is often invested in education and healthcare.For certain products, such as coffee, cocoa, cotton and rice, only small farmer organizations can be certified Fairtrade.On larger farms, such as some Fairtrade vineyards, workers are allowed to organize independently. Workers also receive Fairtrade benefits that they can reinvest in the community.Locally Grown FoodSustainably Grown and Raised FoodSustainable Fish and SeafoodSocially Responsible ProductsLocal Produce Purchasing Programs (by province / region)Partnering with growers and distributors Canada widePromoting local with “Locally Grown” identifiers and seasonal menu featuresLocal dairy products and shell eggs served provinciallyCanadian RaisedPurchase / Promotion of Canadian raised protein itemsSustainable Seafood Purchasing Program under developmentPartnering with SeaChoice CanadaConverting key seafood purchases to ocean friendly ecologically sustainable alternatives as per Canada’s Seafood GuideSustainably Grown / RaisedExpanding purchasing programs and availability of organic, naturally raised, pasture raised / grass fed, and cage free items.Organic Fair Trade and Rain Forest Alliance CertifiedOrganic Fair Trade and Rain Forest Alliance Certified coffee selections offered and promoted throughout our coffee conceptsAnnual donation and support of Coffee Kids program - www.coffeekids.orgDisposable packagingPaper productsCleaning productsSource packaging (food / non food)Developed Green packaging programs, guide and decision making toolsGoal to transition disposable packaging to items that are biodegradable, recyclable, and/or made from recycled content, and that minimize our dependence on non-renewable resourcesOptions vary based on waste management programs and facilities within different locations and municipalitiesEncourage use of reusable products such as travel mugsProvision of napkins / paper towels made from 100% recycled content, non-chlorinated, EcoLogo certifiedUtilize dispensers designed to limit usage/wasteRecycled paper used for print collateralConversion of ware washing, all purpose, glass and floor cleaners, and hand soap to Green Seal Certified products where available and/or to greener alternativesProducts are non-toxic, non-caustic, biodegradable and water based and provide packaging efficiencyPurchase of products with minimal packaging and in bulk to reduce wastePartnering with suppliers who share our visionReducing and reusing source packagingEnabling recovery and reuse of discarded materials, and recycling wasteRecycling 100% of our cooking oilExploring onsite and offsite composting initiatives and implementing where feasible – includes back of house kitchen food waste composting programs as well as post consumer composting programsConducting waste evaluationsUtilizing and building on Waste Management DirectoryComprehensive staff training on waste management and reduction initiativesDevelopment of Comprehensive Staff Training and Recognition Programs to encourage energy and water conservationReducing and/or eliminating the use of trays helps to: conserve energy by eliminating the need to heat water for washing trays, conserve water and reduce chemical usage (detergents, rinse and drying agents) used for washing trays.Increasing availability of foods that are produced in a sustainable mannerRegular themed meals and events including Locally Grown, Vegetarian and ‘Cool Planet’ menu options, and Dim the Lights dining days.Information provided on menu options and ingredients, including on their source and the benefits of eating seasonally, locally, sustainably and perhaps lower on the food chain even just a few times a week! facebooktwittergoogleyoutubelinkedinpinterestinstagramflickr© Concordia UniversityTermsPrivacyAccessibilityWebsite feedback
