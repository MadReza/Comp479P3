Montreal has long been revered for its trendy cafés, delis and restaurants. As a cultural hub whose diversity is reflected in a broad range of gourmet wonders, it is the perfect city for any eager student gastronome.While culinary experiences abound in the city’s many nooks and crannies, we’ve drawn up this list with hungry Concordians in mind.Here are some must-try items that can be found in and around the university’s two campuses.Sometimes you’ve got to appease your inner glutton, and what better way to do that than with a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on a pretzel bun, with brie cheese and Sriracha mayo. Luckily you don’t need to go far for this meaty creation —  it’s available at the newly renovated Reggie’s, located in the Henry F. Hall (H) Building.The dish is a personal favourite of Adrian Longinotti, finance coordinator for the Concordia Student Union (CSU). “Not only will you be getting a meat mess between two slices of bread, but a sandwich with in-house dressing, quality toppings and deep-fried onions… Yes, deep-fried onions.”Head to Bento in the J.W. McConnell (LB) Building for this Canadian twist on the California roll, which marries steelhead salmon with teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, green onions and a drizzle of maple syrup — definitely a must for the explorative palate.Another notable option is the rainbow row, for those who can’t choose between fresh crab, shrimp, salmon and tuna.The People’s Potato on the seventh floor of the Henry F. Hall (H) Building offers by-donation vegan lunches every weekday during the fall and winter terms from 12:30 to 2 pm. Just bring your own plate and enjoy. Plus, don’t forget to download the vegan cookbook!You can also head over to Mother Hubbard’s Cupboard at Concordia’s Multi-faith and Spirituality Centre for supper, where you can get a free vegan dinner (a $2 donation is recommended) every Thursday from 5 to 7 pm during the academic year.
 You can have it any way you want at the Green Beet Café, whose brand new make-your-own pizza station will be up and running this fall.Fill your topping bowl with a variety of veggies and meats, then hand it over to the café’s resident pizza maker who will bake your custom creation on site.The café, which is located on the fourth floor of the Hall Building, also offers a myriad of vegetarian and vegan-friendly lunch options as well as four selections of fair trade coffee.Freshii is now offering daily $6 specials at its location in the LB Building.What’s on the menu? On Monday it's the teriyaki twist bowl, Tuesday: smoke house burrito, Wednesday: Buddha satay bowl, Thursday: spicy lemon grass soup, and Friday: buffalo wrap.Freshii’s meals and snacks are often fibre-rich, with slow-burning carbs, essential fats and lean proteins.For wonton soup and noodle bowls, Roi Du Wonton on Saint-Marc Street is the place to go.Melissa-Anne Menard, a recent Concordia graduate and member of the Student Success Centre, says be sure to ask at the counter for their secret “blow-your-taste-buds-away” hot sauce.“It’s especially good to help you breathe easier when you have a cold during those dark, freezing winter days.”For tried and trusted less-than-$3 falafel sandwiches, check out Nilufar, at 1923 Sainte-Catherine Street West.“Hands down the best falafel sandwich I’ve had,” says Menard.“Their garlic potatoes and tofu sandwiches are also fabulous, and don’t even get me started on their vegan brownie — it’s a godsend and an ideal end of term pick-me-up. Their sandwiches are also sold at Le Frigo Vert.” 
 Every day you can enjoy the all-you-care-to-eat service offered at the Buzz Dining Hall. Breakfasts only cost $5.99 while lunch and dinners are $8.99.Beyond the salad and pizza bar, you will also find a variety of warm dishes such as butter chicken, oven jerk pork, sage chicken curry and lamb tajine.Can’t get to the People’s Potato from Loyola in time for free lunches? Don’t fret; you can also enjoy free vegetarian meals throughout the year at the Hive; lunch starts at 12:30 pm.The Market, located in the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex (SP Building), is your place for on-the-go meal options with a gourmet twist. Pick your protein from a selection of pre-prepared local meats, organic chicken and fresh salmon filets then bring it to the counter to be heated.You can customize your plate by adding tasty sides such as grilled zucchini, roasted potatoes and kale.There are also plenty of grab-and-go type snacks and sandwiches.If you’re stationed at the Loyola Campus this coming fall, it’s worth your while to walk 10 minutes up Sherbrooke Street West to Café Bano. The charming little café has what may be the best schnitzel sandwich on the island — and you can order it spicy!It also offers homemade Persian- and Israeli-inspired cuisine. Caffeine break: cappuccino and macaroon time!Café 92 is a tranquil coffee house also located on Sherbrooke Street West and a favourite among neighbourhood locals.While the cappuccino and macaroons are particularly popular, you can also sample a large variety of teas and indulge in bistro-style food — often with a Mexican twist, reflecting the heritage of two of its owners.
