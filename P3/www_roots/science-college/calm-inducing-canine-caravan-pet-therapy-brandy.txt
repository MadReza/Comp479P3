Final exams can be stressful. And while there are lots of ways to beat exam stress, from exercise to meditation, is there anything more comforting than a furry friend with a wagging tail?In December, the Georges P. Vanier Library, on the Loyola Campus, and the R. Howard Webster Library, on the Sir George Williams Campus, will welcome several pet-therapy dogs from the Blue Ribbon Canine Centre to help students relax.The visits at the Vanier Library will take place from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, December 1, and from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Monday, December 5, outside of Room VL-101.  The Webster Library visit will take place from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Wednesday, December 7, on the third floor of the J.W. McConnell Building (LB3).Similar sessions have been held successfully at McGill University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the University of Wisconsin; and Yale University to help reduce anxiety and lift spirits.Concordia's own therapeutic furry friend visits were featured on CBC last spring. All of the dogs have been vaccinated and will be on four-foot leashes.
