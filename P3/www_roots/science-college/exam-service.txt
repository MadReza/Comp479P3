http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/accessibility/exam-service.htmlThis section is designed to help you go through the process of booking an exam using the portal. It is important to understand that a successful booking is only the first step in a set of complicated logistical procedures that the ACSD Exam Coordinator has to complete in a very short period of time for well over two thousand midterms and an equal amount of final exams. Because of this, it is imperative that you make every effort to book your exams as soon as your Professor has notified you that there is to be an exam. In order for you to write Final exams, Supplemental Final exams or Deferred Final Exams with accommodations, you must make your request using your portal (instructions are below) on or before the following date:Fall Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: November 5thWinter Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: March 7thSummer 1 Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: May 27thSummer 2 Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: July 20thBooking an eConcordia exam? Find out how.To book an ACSD exam, go to your Portal at https://myconcordia.ca.Please be sure to check the "My calendar of ACSD appointments and exams" 24-72 hours before the exam for the exact starting time of your ACSD exam.When you book an exam online, your professor will receive a notice by email with the test details. However, we strongly encourage you to follow up with instructors to ensure that they are up to date about the booking and your needs.If you are booking an eConcordia exam, follow these additional steps below.In case you have any difficulties, here are a few tips:    Booking exams with E-Concordia is a 2-step process.In-term exams:For students registered with the ACSD before the add/drop deadline, the E-Concordia team will contact you via email to inform you about your accommodated time on exams. Essentially, the additional time you have as an accommodation will be applied to your exams automatically.For students who register with the ACSD after the add/drop deadline, contact the E-Concordia team at acsd@econcordia.com and provide them with the accommodated time you receive and your list of E-Concordia courses.Final Exams:E-Concordia final exams are written in class. Book your final exam via your student portal by March 6th, 2016.  Nothing will be set up automatically for your final exams.The ACSD works collaboratively with the Examination Office to run the accommodated exam services for the University. All Concordia students are expected to follow the procedures and meet the deadline dates as established by the Examinations Office. The ACSD Advisors are there to assist you should you have questions or concerns regarding the reporting of exam conflicts, medical notations, deferred exams, etc.Students who require the use of adaptive or assistive technology during an exam must first meet with the ACSD Technology Specialist in order to be trained on the use of the software during an examination situation as well as understand how to apply to use the technology during an exam.Have further questions after reviewing the above information?
