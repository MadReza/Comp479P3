Founded in 1979, the Science College espouses the following well-defined, distinct, and important concepts of science education: student participation in laboratory research activities from the first year on and a curriculum emphasizing cross-disciplinary thinking as well as intensive student-faculty and student-student interaction. The Science College accepts as members applicants who show high motivation and potential for excellence. It's academic program complements the regular undergraduate program.The following principles underlie the philosophy of the education offered by the College:The elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind:The Science College is intended to allow a student to become independent, self-motivated, and articulate. Students should emerge with a profound understanding of a chosen discipline and reasonable literacy in other branches of science.Science College:

                Science is a system of thought and not a collection of facts.Science does not exist in a void, but forms part of the human tradition.Science education is traditionally compartmentalized into departments, but science itself crosses those borders.Education is not a zero-sum game. Thus, the Science College promotes and encourages a non-competitive atmosphere that complements its success.Students are involved in actual research for their entire stay at the College.Students must take a 6-credit course on the "historical, sociological and philosophical aspects of science."Students take interdisciplinary courses designed specifically for them.About the departmentProgramsResearchStudent lifeNews & eventsContact usfacebooktwittergoogleyoutubelinkedinpinterestinstagramflickr© Concordia UniversityTermsPrivacyAccessibilityWebsite feedback
