http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/news/public-lecture-series/past-lectures/cosmic-gift-of-neutron-stars.htmlDr. Victoria M. KaspiABSTRACT: Though thousands of light years away, neutron stars can act as precise cosmic beacons, a cosmic gift that sheds light on some of the most interesting problems in modern science. In this talk I will introduce these bizarre objects, and show how astronomers are using them to study topics which range from the origins of the Universe to the very nature of matter.THE SPEAKER: Victoria Kaspi, holds the Lorne Trottier Chair in Astrophysics and Cosmology, and a Canada Research Chair in Observational Astrophysics at McGill University© Concordia UniversityLoyola Campus
