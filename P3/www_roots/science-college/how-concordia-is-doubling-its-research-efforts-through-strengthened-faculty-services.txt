Concordia’s Office of Research (OOR) is offering an enhanced series of workshops and clinics this summer to respond to the evolving needs of faculty members.Beginning August 23, the OOR presents three days of sessions on both campuses designed to increase the success of applications to federal and provincial funding agency programs, guiding researchers through various program requirements and highlighting changes to process.These important workshops will include question-and-answer periods with successfully funded Concordia researchers, as well as those who have sat on agency adjudication committees, and representatives from federal programs and various industry partners.The OOR will for the first time also offer a series of research administration clinics that will allow researchers face time with key university research support personnel who will answer questions and advise on matters related to grants, facilitation, ethics, safety, payroll and much more.  Graham Carr, vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, notes that as a result of a survey sent to researchers last fall, OOR staff have continued to improve research services for faculty, but also to solidify inter-departmental collaborations with units such as Financial Services, Environmental Health and Safety, and Human Resources. He hopes that efforts to improve cohesion and offer hands-on help will allow faculty members to resolve issues quickly and effectively when managing their research portfolios.“Increasing the success of grant applications and research portfolio management are tangible ways for us to double our research,” he says. “It is important to continuously evolve our service offerings based on what researchers have to say and encourage collaboration across the board.”Also new from OOR in 2016 is Research ASSIST-U, an online help feature that allows researchers to fill out a form to connect with a specialist who can assist them with research-related questions.
