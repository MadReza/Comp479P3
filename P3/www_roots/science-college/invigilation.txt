http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/exams/invigilation.htmlThe Exams office offers invigilation positions to graduate students, or other interested parties who are not current undergraduate students.The primary purpose of the exam invigilator is to ensure the integrity of the examination exercise as specified in Concordia University’s Academic Code of Conduct.The exam invigilator is the primary contact for students in the exam room and is responsible for administering all aspects of the examination. He/she is required to adhere to the instructions for each individual exam as presented by the professor and ensure that students understand and comply with those instructions.Invigilators report instances of offences committed by students under the Academic Code of Conduct during an examination including cheating, falsification of documents or other dishonest behavior; distribute and collect exam documents; monitor the class while the exam is in session; accompany students who need to leave the classroom for any reason once the exam is underway, including accompanying students to the restroom; act as the point of first contact for students and faculty who may have a problem in the exam room and escalate issues as appropriate to the Supervisor. Specific duties are further outlined in the orientation/ training session.The invigilator is charged with upholding the university’s academic code of conduct and therefore must formally report all instances of cheating or dishonest behaviour during the final examination period. The invigilator will ensure that all exam-related paperwork and processes (such as incident reports) are completed during and by the end of each shift. He/she ensures the security of examinations documents.The exam invigilator will have limited autonomy and exercise judgment within a restricted scope of activity. Any aspect of the exam invigilation process that falls outside the limited scope must be brought to the Supervisor, the Supervisor will inform the Examination Coordinator.The Exam Invigilator reports directly to the Supervisor.Invigilation positions are offered to graduate students, and other interested parties who are not current undergraduate students.The incumbent works in a classroom setting. He/she must be able to circulate quietly and comfortably around the room during the examination period. In addition, invigilators must be able to remain alert and monitor the class throughout the duration of the exam process. He/she will be required to deal with students under stress.Candidates selected to work as invigilators are required to attend a mandatory (paid) orientation/training session that will take place on a Sunday or Monday evening before the start of the examination period. Shifts are in 4 hour blocks.Exam invigilators normally work in teams and at times on their own or with a professor. Invigilators are expected to remain in the classroom for the duration of the examination. Invigilators may not take restroom breaks during the first hour of the exam. After the first hour has lapsed, floor supervisors circulate from room to room to see if invigilators require a quick restroom break.Invigilation staff are asked not to bring any electronic devices (such as cell phones, laptops, ipods/ipads, notepads, e-readers, etc.) into the exam rooms and all personal belongings (such as coats, backpacks, briefcases, magazines, newspapers, etc.) must be left in the staff room. This room is locked during exams. There is a one hour break for invigilation staff between each 4 hour exam block.We are looking for mature, professional, ethical, responsible, reliable, committed, and punctual people who are fluent in English (spoken and written); who can communicate effectively (read aloud correctly and understandably); who are able to work in a stressful environment, handle difficult situations and resolve problems. Must be able to work as part of a team or individually. Basic to moderate French (spoken) is an asset. Current undergraduate students are not eligible for this position.Please submit a C.V. to the Academic Scheduling and Examinations Office either in person at room GM-210 or by email at: exams.invigilators@concordia.caC.V.’s are accepted in January and in September only. Interviews will be held prior to the examination period.Examination Office© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFinal examination invigilatorStudent hub
