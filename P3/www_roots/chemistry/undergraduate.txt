http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/mechanical-industrial/students/undergraduate.htmlRegistration in specific course sections is on a first-come first-serve basis. Students are strongly recommended to register for immediately at the beginning of the registration cycle. For complete registration info as well as exact start dates please consult Course Registration.Additional rules regarding registration regulations and pre-requisites are outlined in the Undergraduate Calendar, section 71.10.4.Full-time students take from 4 to 6 courses per semester. You should adhere to the suggested Course Sequences for your program in order to avoid scheduling conflicts or lack of pre-requisites. If you feel that you need a reduced course load, or have any other concerns, please see your Undergraduate Program Assistant for advice before dropping any of your courses.Students who are out-of-sequence may encounter course scheduling conflicts, exam schedule conflicts, be missing critical prerequisites, or find a lack of course offerings to suit their needs. For these reasons, we encourage out-of-sequence students to try and get back into our recommended sequences as soon as possible.If you are anticipating a change of sequence or have already received your “Change of Sequence Form” from Co-op, please follow the steps below BEFORE contacting your Undergraduate Program Assistant/Director. Once you have a plan laid out, we will review it with you and approve it if necessary (i.e. Co-op students).Step 1: Review your Advisement Report in MyConcordia.Step 2: Download the current official Course Sequence for your program.

 Step 3: Review the pre-requisite requirements for your remaining courses. You can use the Un-Official Sequence Flowcharts (Mechanical Flowchart or Industrial Flowchart) in addition to the course descriptions in the Undergraduate Calendar to assist you. Please note that the Undergraduate Calendar is the only official listing of rules and regulations, including pre-requisite requirements.
Step 4: Research the availability of your necessary courses using the current Class Schedule or our ENCS Course Schedules (which includes previously offered summer courses). Please note that our schedule may change from year to year so there is no guarantee of availability, but it is a good place to start your planning. Step 5: Draft out a plan of your remaining courses. You may use this Sequence Template if you wish. Note: Co-op students may have additional requirements. Please review your Co-op Handbook for details.
Step 6: Have your Undergraduate Program Assistant/Director review and approve your plan.Undergraduate Program AssistantUndergraduate Program Director (Mechanical)Undergraduate Program Director (Industrial)
