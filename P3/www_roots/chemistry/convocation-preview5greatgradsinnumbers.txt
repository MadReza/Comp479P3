As milestones go, it’s hard to beat a university graduation.All the hard work is about to pay off for Concordia’s most recent cohort of 1,900 graduates from across the university’s four Faculties and the School of Graduate Studies. On Tuesday October 28, they’ll receive their well-deserved certificates, diplomas and degrees.This year, the university’s fall convocation is being held at Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier in Place des Arts. The ceremonies roll out at 10 a.m. for the Faculty of Arts and Science; at 3 p.m. for the John Molson School of Business; and at 7:30 p.m. for the Faculty of Fine Arts and the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.We asked these five standout students for the secrets to their success.

                “Passion — being intellectually driven by one’s field of study is essential to having the strength to persevere when the going gets tough.” “Harmony — a comfortable balance between school, relationships and extracurricular activities creates a favorable environment for a flourishing education.“Open-mindedness — a learner must welcome, and be stimulated by challenging perspectives.”“There is no universal recipe for success. While people’s advice may be useful, ultimately people develop their own personal learning styles.”“Professors play an invaluable role in a student’s life. They are much more than mere sources of knowledge. They guide us, they provoke us, but most importantly, they inspire us.”“Explore! Dare to dive into the unknown.”“Commitment to a vision. The PhD experience is a complex journey with many twists and turns that could easily derail. To succeed, you must never lose sight of the ultimate objective.”“Flexibility. While commitment to the vision is critical, the successful PhD student possesses a curious mind and stays flexible to experience a more fruitful journey.”“Opportunism in learning. There is so much to learn as a graduate student and being a student gives you the perfect excuse to express your curiosity!”“There are many different lenses that can be applied to observe the same phenomenon. At Concordia, I found a great opportunity to benefit from sitting in classes from various disciplines and to understand how not just one, but many theoretical perspectives could exist in parallel.”“I learned that everyone has something you can learn from. One’s apparent limitation is never a good excuse for dismissal of other capabilities. At Concordia, I learned that you should always meet others with an open mind to learn because your refusal to do so means that you have lost an opportunity.“More important than the diploma you receive is the experience you gain along the way. Try to ensure that this experience is one you stay fond of for the remainder of your life.”“Have a forward-looking plan. You should have a clear vision about your goals, talents, available opportunities, then plan accordingly.”“Seek out a knowledgeable and supportive advisor. I was honored to have one such advisor at Concordia, Prof. Amir G. Aghdam.”“Collaborate with other researchers. I enjoyed fruitful collaborative research with Stephane Blouine from Defence Research and Development Canada during my PhD.”  “Never lose hope when working on a problem. If you find the door closed, try the window!”“Get inspirations from daily life to come up with research ideas. Observe, model and analyze what you find interesting.”“Before you start a path, look ahead as far as you can. Imagine yourself reaching the goal and see how satisfied will you be with what you achieve.”“Study what you love. If you love it, it’s fun, not work. You won’t spend all that energy motivating yourself to get to your readings.”“Be curious! You don’t always need a prof to read a book or to answer a question. Learning it for yourself is much more rewarding.“Don’t sweat the small stuff. There are always bumps in the road, learn from them and stay confident in yourself.”“You don’t have to wait until you’re done with your studies to start living. You need your twenties to meet new people, try new things and just figure out who you are as an individual, not just as a professional.“No man (or woman) is an island. You don’t need to figure everything out alone! If you’re not the expert in something, find someone who is.”People will always try to fit you into a labelled box. Surprise them. Well-rounded people don’t fit in square boxes. You can be great at more than one thing.”“During your education, join strong teams with active advisors.”“Cultivate your imagination to help solve problems and find creative solutions.”“Work as hard as you can on each task. That’s the key.”“Support! Always help your team members and other friends as much as you can.”“Uphold a professional research environment.”“Define your goals, make as many professional connections as possible and get ready for challenges.”
