There are strict deadlines for applications from registered students because labs start in the second week of term:Fill in a departmental lab exemption request form.Note: Depending on your browser configuration, you may have to save the blank form, fill in the saved copy, and then re-save it to preserve the information you entered. Here is how to fill in PDF formsPlease make sure you do not e-mail a blank form!Certain student requests are handled by the Faculty of Arts and Science, but require a departmental advisor's signature for processing. For more information and forms, see the faculty web site. Such requests include:If you think you have done one or more program courses elswhere, which have not already been recognised as part of your admission conditions, and you wish to apply for transfer credit for them, you need to fill in the application form, and provide the department with as much information about the courses as possible.A brief calendar description is usually not adequate. Return the form and supporting materials to the departmental office.Forms are available from the Departmental Office , or Prof. P. Pawelek, for permission to do CHEM450 (Honours Thesis) or CHEM419 (Independent Study)Most professors in the Department recommmend, and many require students taking their courses to attend a seminar about plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. Get more information about the academic integrity seminar.These are courses given only occasionally, and which are not described in the Undergraduate Calendar.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityProcedures & formsDepartment of Chemistry & Biochemistry
