http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/offices/vpaer/aar/2015/02/17/forever-young-alumnas-healthy-aging-tips.htmlThough people are living longer than ever, are they living better? The topic is explored by Concordia alumna Arezou Azarani, BSc 92, and her husband Mehrdad Ayati, a medical doctor. Together, the duo wrote Paths to Healthy Aging (self-published, 2014). The book is a guide to quality of life for older adults.“We wanted to write something the general public could understand,” says Azarani. "The majority of books on the subject are too technical."The San Francisco resident says the work took over a year to produce.  “Our knowledge is quite complementary,” says Azarani on teaming up with her husband, who specializes in geriatrics.Azarani holds a PhD in physiology from McGill, completed a post-doctoral fellowship at Université de Montréal in 1997 and another at Stanford University in 1999.At Concordia, Azarani studied biochemistry and took advantage of the university’s Institute for Co-operative Education.“It was wonderful. Concordia is my favourite university,” says Azarani.The Concordian offers four tips for healthy aging:1. Be wary of marketing: “Vitamins and over-the-counter supplements have millions of dollars of advertising behind them. Data suggests most people get everything they need from a balanced diet.”Azarani notes the same can be said of exercise. “Fitness is highly commercialized. We’re encouraged to join gyms, buy equipment and workout strenuously. Moderate exercise is usually enough.”2. Too much medication is a problem: “As we age, we deal with multiple chronic illnesses,” says Azarani. “As a result, lots of medications are prescribed.”Citing the U.S. as an example, nearly 40 per cent of seniors take over five medications. Drug interactions and side effects can be fatal, explains Azarani.3. Think about nutrition: “With age, we lose our appetites and taste buds. The amount of muscle we have decreases,” says Azarani. “The best practice is to eat a range of foods that we enjoy and that are healthy.”The book itself emphasizes the importance of consuming fats, carbohydrates and protein — warning against diets that eliminate one of these groups.4. Choose a physician wisely: “You should find someone you trust, who cares about your specific needs,” says Azarani. She notes that in the U.S. it can be difficult to find a primary care physician.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityForever young: alumna’s healthy aging tipsDepartment of Chemistry & Biochemistry
