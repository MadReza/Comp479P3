http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/administration-governance/office-vp-research-graduate-studies.htmlConcordia’s research activities add $177 million annually to the Quebec economy. That’s why the Office of Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies (OVPRGS) takes great pride in serving and supporting the university’s researchers. The Office offers an array of services to help dedicated researchers and promote the results of their research — whether it’s maximizing funding opportunities, establishing international research partnerships or guiding them through the university’s policies and procedures.Managing more than 100 graduate programs and 6,500 students, the Office also oversees admissions standards and graduation requirements. Since graduate students play a key role in research, the Office provides several services – from application to thesis – to support graduate students. Justin PowlowskiInterim Vice-President, Research and Graduate StudiesLynn HughesAssociate Vice-President, ResearchFerhat KhendekAssociate Vice-President, ResearchHeather Adams-RobinetteDirector, Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies SectorPaula Wood-AdamsDean of Graduate StudiesAndrew LangDirector, Concordia InternationalMichèle ThériaultDirector, Leonard & Bina Ellen Art GalleryDirector, Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology

The School is also home to the Special Individualized Program, a unique interdisciplinary program that allows outstanding students to create their own program of study, drawing on research interests that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.Through Concordia International, the Vice-President plays a leadership role in promoting (international) student mobility as well as international research initiatives.The Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery is part of Concordia University and is dedicated to the research, dissemination and critical examination of Canadian and international contemporary art. As part of its programming, it presents exhibitions, provides various educational programs and produces publications. Responsibility for all tasks related to the management, exhibition, research and conservation of the Gallery’s art collection is also part of its mandate.The Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology is a research unit working at the intersection of design, art, culture and technology. It is a platform for progressive imagining, critical studies, creative experimenting and interdisciplinary training where thinking and making come together to transform our encounter with technology.The PERFORM Centre is a unique facility dedicated to improving health through prevention. The centre combines research, education and community engagement in the areas of physical activity, rehabilitation, nutrition and lifestyle change.
