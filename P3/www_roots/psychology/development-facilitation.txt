http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/research/for-researchers/development-facilitation.htmlA few of the key services provided by the Development and Facilitation team include: All proposals submitted by University faculty members are reviewed by Office of Research staff to ensure adherence to internal and external policies and procedures.  Certain aspects of the application process need significant lead time before the agency deadline, such as preparation of an online curriculum vitae or translation requirements. More details on the application process and important deadlines are available on our website, or contact your faculty research facilitator or another member of the Office of Research staff team for further information.
Once a funding opportunity has been identified, the applicant(s) (primary investigator and co-applicants) should consult the up-to-date agency guidelines, eligibility criteria and the deadline for the program of interest. It is recommended to start developing the application well in advance of the agency deadline. Work closely with your Research Facilitator who is available to provide support and offer feedback on early drafts and advice throughout the application process:Once an agency notifies the Office of Research, we will disseminate the results of the competition to the Faculties and applicants. The Office of Research issues the notices of award and liaises with Restricted Funds in Financial Services for the opening of research accounts. Research Facilitators seek out targeted funding opportunities for their respective faculty researchers, cultivate relationships with researchers, and review and develop grant applications. They are based within the Faculties and are part of the Office of Research team.Learn more about the Faculty of Arts and Science's Research and Graduate Studies Office (Cpasce).Learn more about the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science's Research Office (Cpasce).Learn more about the Faculty of Fine Art's research services (Cpasce).Learn more about the John Molson School of Business' research services (Cpasce). NOTE: these forms are to be used ONLY by researchers who have not yet taken up their appointment at Concordia University, as well as affiliate professors who do not have access to ConRAD.  All other researchers must submit through ConRAD. © Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityDevelopment and FacilitationDevelop your applicationSubmit your applicationCommunication of resultsConnect with usFaculty of Arts and ScienceFaculty of Engineering and Computer ScienceFaculty of Fine ArtsJohn Molson School of BusinessAsk us a questionSteps to applyConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424Study resourcesCalendar - GraduateCalendar - UndergraduateClass schedulesClass cancellationsCourse registrationImportant academic datesMore academic resourcesCampus servicesConcordia storesIT servicesJob opportunitiesSecurityShuttle busStudent Service Centre (Birks)All campus servicesWhat's newCalendar of eventsLatest newsMedia RelationsFaculties, Schools & CollegesArts and ScienceEngineering and Computer ScienceFine ArtsJohn Molson School of BusinessSchool of Graduate StudiesAll Schools, Colleges & DepartmentsStudy resources
