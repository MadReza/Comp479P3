These university-wide principles are intended to ensure that research chairs and units are recognized, selected, and financed in a coherent and visionary manner to support and advance the academic and research priorities of the University.In June 2007, the Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies convened a Committee to review the roles and responsibilities of the School of Graduate Studies.  The Committee membership comprised Associate Deans from each of the Faculties and Schools, faculty members from each Faculty/School with experience in the administration of graduate programs, the Executive Director of Enrolment Services, the Executive Provost, the Associate Vice-President International and a graduate student. The final committee report is now available.

Its mandate was to suggest a series of innovative initiatives (punctual actions, programs, policies, etc.) to address the new opportunities and challenges facing Concordia because of the rapidly increasing research intensity. The committee was co-chaired by Drs. Louise Dandurand and Camille Limoges (Retired Deputy Minister, Quebec Ministry of Research, Science and Technology). It was composed of nine other members: two from OVPRGS, five from the university’s four Faculties and two from external organizations.After a thorough review of current best practices, policy documents and other relevant publications, several round-table meetings and two lengthy sessions dedicated exclusively to an extensive SWOT analysis, the committee tabled a report in August 2007 and proposed a set of enabling strategies, grouped under three overarching recommendations:For full report  Concordia University opens its research findings to the worldConcordia University’s academic community has passed a landmark Senate Resolution on Open Access that encourages all of its faculty and students to make their peer-reviewed research and creative output freely accessible via the internet. Concordia is the first major university in Canada where faculty have given their overwhelming support to a concerted effort to make the full results of their research universally available.“Concordians have, once again, found a way to share their innovative findings and creativity with communities the world over”, says Judith Woodsworth, President and Vice-Chancellor of Concordia. “As befits its role as host of the Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences next month, our university is now leading the way on this year’s Congress theme: Connected Understanding/le savoir branché.”Gerald Beasley, Concordia’s University Librarian, was instrumental in the campus-wide dialogue on open access that began more than a year ago. “I am delighted that Senate voted to support the recommendations of all four Faculty Councils and the Council of the School of Graduate Studies. There are only a handful of precedents in North America for the kind of leadership that Concordia faculty have demonstrated by their determination to make publicly-funded research available to all rather than just the minority able to afford the rapidly rising subscription costs of scholarly databases, books and journals.”This past year, Concordia launched Spectrum, an open access digital repository that continues to grow beyond its initial 6,000 dissertations submitted at Concordia, and at its predecessors Sir George Williams University and Loyola College. The Senate Resolution encourages all of Concordia’s researchers to deposit their research and creative work in Spectrum.Source: Media Relations.   © Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityArchivesOpen Access at ConcordiaNew policies on Research Chairs and Research UnitsReview of the School of Graduate StudiesStrengthening Research Capacity, Alliances and Outreach CommitteeConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424Study resourcesCalendar - GraduateCalendar - UndergraduateClass schedulesClass cancellationsCourse registrationImportant academic datesMore academic resourcesCampus servicesConcordia storesIT servicesJob opportunitiesSecurityShuttle busStudent Service Centre (Birks)All campus servicesWhat's newCalendar of eventsLatest newsMedia RelationsFaculties, Schools & CollegesArts and ScienceEngineering and Computer ScienceFine ArtsJohn Molson School of BusinessSchool of Graduate StudiesAll Schools, Colleges & DepartmentsStudy resources

                New policies on Research Chairs and Research Units
In April, 2010, the Senate adopted two new policies which will guide the management and administration of Research Chairs and Research Units at Concordia. These university-wide principles are intended to ensure that research chairs and units are recognized, selected, and financed in a coherent and visionary manner to support and advance the academic and research priorities of the University.
Review of the School of Graduate Studies
In June 2007, the Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies convened a Committee to review the roles and responsibilities of the School of Graduate Studies.  The Committee membership comprised Associate Deans from each of the Faculties and Schools, faculty members from each Faculty/School with experience in the administration of graduate programs, the Executive Director of Enrolment Services, the Executive Provost, the Associate Vice-President International and a graduate student. The final committee report is now available.

Strengthening Research Capacity, Alliances and Outreach Committee
This committee was struck in May 2007, as part of the University’s strategic planning exercise. Its mandate was to suggest a series of innovative initiatives (punctual actions, programs, policies, etc.) to address the new opportunities and challenges facing Concordia because of the rapidly increasing research intensity. The committee was co-chaired by Drs. Louise Dandurand and Camille Limoges (Retired Deputy Minister, Quebec Ministry of Research, Science and Technology). It was composed of nine other members: two from OVPRGS, five from the university’s four Faculties and two from external organizations.
After a thorough review of current best practices, policy documents and other relevant publications, several round-table meetings and two lengthy sessions dedicated exclusively to an extensive SWOT analysis, the committee tabled a report in August 2007 and proposed a set of enabling strategies, grouped under three overarching recommendations:

Accelerate the development and deployment of research capacity
Intensify outreach and visibility of expertise; pursue partnerships and alliances
Strengthen university-wide policies and procedures in support of research and service to researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral students
