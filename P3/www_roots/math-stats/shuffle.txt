http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/archives/stories/shuffle.htmlThe Concordia Shuffle is an annual 6.5-kilometre walk, held in the fall, between the University's Sir George Williams and Loyola campuses to benefit student scholarships and bursaries. 

In 1990 University Advancement initiated and launched a campus-to-campus walk-a-thon fundraiser to increase internal community support for its fundraising efforts and to build morale within the university. 

Faculty members, staff, senior administrators, University governors, and student shufflers solicit pledges from friends, family, and colleagues for completing the walk. Money raised for the Concordia Shuffle initially went towards undergraduate student scholarships and bursaries but since 2000 the funds are also used for graduate students. 

The Shuffle is a fun-filled, feel-good event, but it also collects much-needed funds for student scholarships and bursaries. Shufflers start at the Sir George Williams Campus, heading west until they reach the Loyola Campus. Most shufflers walk the route, but some participants are very creative. Some shufflers use the route as a test of their physical fitness by running, cycling or rollerblading to Loyola. Others walk with loved ones, friends, co-workers or pets, and some push baby strollers or pull children's wagons. Many departments walk together. The Shuffle T-shirts issued to participants have become hot commodities!© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia ShuffleConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424Study resourcesCalendar - GraduateCalendar - UndergraduateClass schedulesClass cancellationsCourse registrationImportant academic datesMore academic resourcesCampus servicesConcordia storesIT servicesJob opportunitiesSecurityShuttle busStudent Service Centre (Birks)All campus servicesWhat's newCalendar of eventsLatest newsMedia RelationsFaculties, Schools & CollegesArts and ScienceEngineering and Computer ScienceFine ArtsJohn Molson School of BusinessSchool of Graduate StudiesAll Schools, Colleges & DepartmentsStudy resources
