Ever wonder what goes on in another building? Feel stuck in your lab or studio? With year two of the FOYER program starting in November, you now have five chances to step out of the ordinary and into the unknown.FOYER is a student space and also a series of programs designed to bring master's and PhD students from all faculties together to find research affinities. It was created last year by the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts with the help of the Office of the Provost and Vice-President, Academic Affairs.This November, students can meet likeminded researchers during FOYER's meet-and-greet sessions, designed to inspire graduate collaboration and conversation.“It’s like graduate student research speed-dating,” says Christine Swintak, the FOYER program manager. “These sessions provide the opportunity to meet up with your counterparts from other faculties and discover how your research interests mesh.”The meet-and-greets are held in the FOYER space, a cozy lounge beside the Junction on the second floor of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (Room 2.781).“The idea is to incubate new research ideas and provide graduate students with access to facilities normally reserved for those outside their discipline,” says Swintak.All MFA and PhD students are also eligible to apply for a FOYER group fellowship. Groups must include two to five students from at least two different faculties hoping to work together as a research team. Fellowship groups receive grants of up to $2,500.FOYER fellows will also receive 24/7 access to the lounge, which will serve as their workspace throughout the semester.Last year’s projects supported by the FOYER fellowship included the creation of a mobile textile antenna prototype using laid conductive thread, and an investigation of the visual and sensorial logic of micro-machinery fabrication and the tools of its creation: molding, casting, plating and etching.“The important thing to remember about this fellowship is that, unlike many granting programs, we are open to a surprising set of outcomes,” says Rebecca Duclos, Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts.“Combined research teams will use FOYER to explore ideas and test out affiliated methodologies to arrive at realizations that may not have emerged had researchers worked in isolation.”Application forms for collaborative research teams starting in the Winter semester 2017 will be available at the following sessions. All sessions are held at FOYER (atrium space outside Room 2.785, 1515 St. Catherine W.) from 4 to 6 p.m.Information session:
