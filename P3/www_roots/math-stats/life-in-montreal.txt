From a history of cutting-edge architecture to icons like Leonard Cohen and Mordechai Richler, to storied Old Montreal and the legendary Schwartz’s Deli, the city thrives on art, culture and history.Montreal is known for its festivals which run one after another all summer long, but festival season never really ends, in this city there is always something to celebrate!Visit Tourism Montreal to find out what’s going on.One of the reasons so many students flock to Montreal is because it's an affordable city. Compare the cost of living in Montreal with other major cities in the world to see for yourself.Montreal has an extensive and accessible public transportation system.
