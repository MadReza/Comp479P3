http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2015/10/15/application-deadlines-for-awards-start-october-23-2015.htmlThe cut-off dates for bursary and scholarship applications are fast approaching. The deadline for undergraduate in-course bursaries (for returning students) is October 31, 2015, and October 23, 2015, for application-based awards and scholarships.The major distinction between scholarships and bursaries is that scholarships tend to be merit-based and granted automatically for academic achievement, whereas bursaries are based on financial need.Consideration for in-course scholarships begins in October and takes into account students’ last annual GPA. You can search available awards by category and department.Concordia also offers scholarships that have additional criteria. Find out if you’re eligible for an application-based award online.Bursaries are intended to help students who cannot afford to pay full fees and require the submission of a number of supporting documents, including a financial need assessment.Here are some of the most-used bursaries:Entrance Bursary is for students entering university for the first time. The bursary is awarded based on a financial needs test, academic ranking and personal statements.In-Course Bursary is for returning students who have attended at least one term of full-time studies at Concordia. Applicants must be in acceptable academic standing, which means a last annual GPA of 2.00 or higher. A smaller number of In-Course Bursaries is available to part-time students.French Language Bursary is for non-Quebec residents and international students to enrol in French classes offered by the university’s Département d'études françaises. The deadline is October 31, 2015.Ministère de l'Éducation, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche (MEESR) Student Mobility Bursary is for Concordians who are planning to go on exchange. It provides students who are Quebec residents and have studied at the university for at least one year with up to $1,000 a month for the duration of their studies abroad.
