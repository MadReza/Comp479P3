http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/degrees/program-length.htmlDepending on your academic background, the average undergraduate program at Concordia takes three or four years to complete.This table shows the time required to complete an undergraduate program at Concordia. Estimates are based on you taking a full course load.3 years (90 credits)While there are exceptions (see below), Concordia offers three and four year Bachelor’s degrees depending on your academic background. Here’s why:The extra academic year Quebec CEGEP graduates do before starting university allows them to complete many programs in three years.Certain programs require more time for all students to finish. These include:If you come to Concordia from a secondary school outside Quebec, you are admitted to the ECP. This requires the completion of 30 credits in addition to the regular (90 or 120 credit) degree program.See each degree description for specific details.Canadians and Permanent Residents who are 21 years of age or older and who lack the normal pre-university schooling may be considered for admission to the MEP, which requires successful completion of a minimum of 18 additional credits.Please see Mature Entry for admissions requirements.The information provided is for reference purposes.
