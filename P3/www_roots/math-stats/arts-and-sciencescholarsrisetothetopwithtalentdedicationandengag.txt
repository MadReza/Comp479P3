Working late at the library can be lonely, but it certainly pays off.On October 15, more than 350 people filled the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall to celebrate Concordia’s 2013-14 Arts and Science Scholars, the top students in the Faculty of Arts and Science.Arts and Science Scholars are students who have earned the highest grade point averages in each academic program during the 2013-14 academic year. Among the 147 scholars honoured last week, 84 per cent have grade point averages of 4.00 or higher, while three achieved a perfect average of 4.3.“This evening is truly a celebration of our scholars’ talent, dedication and engagement,” said André Roy, dean of Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science, as he congratulated the scholars.Miranda D’Amico, associate dean of the faculty’s Student Academic Services, offered a few words for the future. “Wherever you go, you are the Faculty of Arts and Science’s fierce ambassadors — be courageous and be adventurous,” she said.Find out how to land a place on the Dean’s List, and how to become an Arts and Science Scholar.
