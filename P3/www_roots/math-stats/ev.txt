http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/maps/buildings/ev.htmlThe Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building) opened in September 2005, a striking addition to Montreal’s downtown landscape. The two towers of the high-tech complex are completely integrated with links at every floor and a common corridor.The 17-storey Engineering and Computer Science tower houses research and graduate teaching labs, administrative offices, and the Dean’s Office. From the many disparate locations in which it was previously housed, this tower integrates a large part of the Faculty in a single space, fostering more effective interaction of researchers. Facilities include over 300 specialized labs, conference and meeting rooms, and student areas.The Visual Arts tower includes some of Studio Arts (Print Media, Fibres, Photography, Design and Computational Arts), Art History and the Dean’s Office. It features improved facilities and equipment for traditional media but also offers access to cutting-edge digital technologies that are organized so they can be easily integrated into the creative process. It also boasts an art gallery, a black box theatre, art history amphitheatres and specialized facilities for Hexagram, the Institute for Research/Creation in Media Arts and Technologies.The first phase of the new fitness and recreation facilities opened in September 2006. It includes a dance studio, a gymnasium, washrooms and locker rooms. The second phase of the construction, completed in January 2007, consists of fitting up the areas for spinning, cardio, weight lifting, karate/judo and aerobics.The Fitness and Recreation Centre is available to students, faculty and staff.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityEngineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated ComplexCampus maps
