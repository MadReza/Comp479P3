Each of the core members will present the latest findings related to their particular area of research.The conference is held to showcase the research of the core members and to engage both undergraduate and graduate students in presenting posters of the research done in their respective labs.In the afternoon the students from CCRH labs will hold a poster session during which time posters will be judged and prizes awarded.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
