                Engaging in regular physical activity has many benefits that include more energy, better concentration, achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, a reduced risk of many illnesses, and it is much better for the environment.Individuals should reduce the amount of time that they are inactive and take the opportunity to make the active choice every chance they get.
Experts recommend 150 minutes of moderate- or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week:  that’s only 30 minutes a day on 5 days of the week.Physical activities can be placed into three main categories (aerobic, strength training and flexibility) with aerobic activities providing the greatest benefits.Exercising too much can lead to consequences such as sleep problems, heart problems, irritability, depression and injury.Brisk walking (here's a walking training schedule for beginners)
Running (here's a running training schedule for beginners)

We sit in a car or on the bus to commute to and from work and schoolWe sit many hours a day in front of a computer, at a desk, in classWe use email, direct-deposit, and online shopping to accomplish tasks that used to require us to walk a bitWe sit to relax: eating, surfing, texting, or socializing with friends.
Limit recreational screen time to no more than 2 hours per day; lower levels are associated with additional health benefits.Limit sedentary (motorized) transport, extended sitting and time spent indoors throughout the day.Plan to stand up from your computer or textbooks for at least a few minutes every hour.Make the active choice every chance you get: take the stairs instead of the elevator, stretch while watching tv, do something active when socializing with friends.The article titled "27 Ideas to Help You Spend Less Time Sitting Down" can give you more ideas.
All adults should avoid inactivity. Some physical activity is better than none, and adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits.For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous intensity aerobic activity. This fun video expands on the idea of "30 minutes a day".
Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes each, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week.For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes a week of moderate intensity, or 150 minutes a week of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous intensity activity.Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.

If you are doing your own research on the Internet be sure to know how to evaluate the reliability of information on the InternetHow to effectively set, achieve and maintain your health goalsPhysical activity and mental healthThe Mayo Clinic website offers informative, evidence-based in-depth articles on a variety of topics related to physical activity.Ready to get started? Mayo Clinic and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) both offer good video collections showing you how to do muscle strengthening exercises properly, as well as ideas for getting started with aerobic activity.The 9 minute video that went viral called "23 1/2 hours:  What is the single best thing we can do for our health" highlights the importance of regular physical activity.Active At Any Size! has information on being active for people who are overweight or obeseNutrition for athletes and active people
