http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/volunteering/award/past-winners.htmlThe LIVE Centre celebrates the selfless efforts of members of the Concordia community who volunteer their time to improve the world around them.Here are this year's winners:Mandy PhamMandy has been involved with a variety of activities to support her local community.She used her talents and knowledge of Human Resources to develop an Employee Handbook for Literacy Unlimited. This document became an important tool for the organization’s staff and Board of Directors. While working on this project, Mandy was recognized for her professionalism and dedication. She also facilitates a project so that her peers studying in Human Resources can gain meaningful work experience before they graduate.Mandy volunteered at Jules Verne Elementary School, where she participated in activities and field trips to ensure the children’s safety. She has also been involved with Youth4Youth, an initiative seeking to bring social awareness through workshops pertaining to today’s younger generation. Additionally, Mandy participated in two fundraising events for Venturing Out Beyond Our Cancer (VOBOC), which supports young adults in their fight against the disease.David ReichmanDavid has been involved in numerous non-profit organizations to empower youth. He is a Big Brother for Chai Lifeline to help children who are suffering from a serious illness. David supports these families by visiting them in the hospital or driving them to and from appointments. At Compeer, he spends time with youth or adults who are receiving mental health services. David has also been a committed peer supporter for the Centre for Gender Advocacy since 2014.David commits six to eight hours per month as a youth mentor at Ometz. There, he’s paired with a child or adolescent and acts as a personal counsellor. At Friendship Circle, he supports children within the autistic spectrum by participating in events, assisting family members with errands, or spending time with the children. David takes the time and effort to help encourage individuals to have stronger beliefs in themselves. Sasha van Frank-AdlerSasha’s dedication to her community has improved the lives of many.Involved in the community since 2009, Sasha has volunteered with numerous organizations to educate, raise funds and be a positive role model for youth. She has tutored young children in English, French and math at the Lansdowne Centre. Sasha also helped with a team that raised money for Santropol Roulant, an organization that improves food security for community members in part by delivering home-cooked meals to seniors’ homes. Since 2014, Sasha has been volunteering with Ometz to support the development of a child from a low-income family.  She has been recognized for her caring attitude, interpersonal skills and commitment to the family that she has been paired with. Sasha’s flexibility and creativity have helped her quickly resolve disputes and positively influence the child’s behaviour. Her dedication and support to this one family is sure to have ripple effects out into the larger community.Lara MackenzieLara has had a passion for animal welfare since a young age. Her dedication has saved and improved the lives of many animals and inspired others to get involved.She has been working with the Montreal SPCA for many years. Lara has helped them organize events, distribute leaflets and fundraise. Through the SPCA, she has fostered sick animals before finding them "forever homes". Lara has also fundraised to help children through Operation Smile and SOS Children’s Villages.Lara is currently the President of Concordia's Animal Rights Association (CARA), which advocates for compassion for all creatures. Each semester, she plans several events that encourage students to volunteer and raise awareness for various animal welfare issues. Lara also helps with the gardens and enrichment activities for the chimpanzees and other animals at the Fauna Foundation sanctuary. Isobel PlowrightIsobel’s involvement in her community has helped make Concordia more inclusive and safe for people of all genders and experiences.Isobel has been involved in a number of projects with the Centre for Gender Advocacy since 2014. She volunteered as a research assistant to assess and identify the number of transgender people who live in Quebec. The results of the project have been used in over 50 workshops and presentations to raise awareness on transgender rights. Isobel is also a trained facilitator of workshops on sexual consent. Her wealth of knowledge and disarming manner has helped her successfully lead numerous workshops for youth. These presentations have clarified what constitutes as sexual violence, what can be done to prevent it and how to support peers who have experienced it. Isobel has also co-taught a facilitation training for new volunteers to lead such workshops.If you know a Concordia student, staff or faculty member who goes over and above in helping the community, please let us know so they can be considered for an award next year!Read more about the criteria and timeline for the Concordia Volunteer Recognition Awards(514) 848-2424, ext. 5578volunteer@concordia.caFollow the LIVE CentreSir George Williams Campus
