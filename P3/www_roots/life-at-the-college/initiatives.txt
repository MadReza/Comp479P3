http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/research/centres/david-obrien/initiatives.htmlDOCSE recently launched a call for research proposals for a new program at JMSB - the Sustainable Real Estate and Built Environment Program. We have recently assembled an advisory board and a scientific committee of professionals and academics with extensive experience in this area. The program focuses on research, events, and curriculum development in sustainable real estate and the built environment. Research projects are interdisciplinary, bringing together academia, industry practitioners, the public and, non-profit sectors. Events are designed to raise awareness among professionals, students, and the public.The program addresses the social, environmental, and economic impacts of sustainable real estate buildings, both locally and further afield. Targeted research enables a deep understanding of urbanization and its impact on global infrastructure demand.For more information, please visit our call for proposals page.
 The Sustainable Internship Program (SIP) is a collaborative program developed and managed by the David O’Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise (DOCSE) and the JMSB Career Management Services (CMS). The SIP offers JMSB undergraduate and graduate students as well as recent alumni the opportunity to gain experience in the domain of sustainability. SIP interns are motivated JMSB students who wish to gain business experience and pursue their passion to create a positive social or environmental impact. Internships typically take place over one semester and are hosted by small businesses and non-profits committed to sustainability. Up to 20 interns per year receive funding from our donor, TD Bank, for their internships through the program.Emerging risks are caused by unexpected events or unfamiliar conditions that that affect both large and small firms and lead to increased volatility and uncertainty. They and their potential consequences are usually poorly understood, making these risks difficult to quantify. The David O’Brien Centre, in collaboration with La Caisse de dépôt et placements du Québec, is exploring the effect of emerging risks (including water, climate change, and cybersecurity-related risks) on investment returns and volatility. Our research will identify measures of exposure to emerging risks and propose workable solutions to managing such risks. 
 In 2010, the David O’Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise in cooperation with Finance and Sustainability Initiative Montreal created the Sustainable Investment Professional Certification (SIPC) Program. This program offers basic sustainability training to business professionals with 70 to 80 hours of self-study curriculum material, online study guidance, certification testing, culminating in the Sustainable Investment Professional Certificate. The program is now a part of JMSB Executive Centre.

 The stairwell project “Be Moved by Art,” completed in 2015, has transformed the Molson Building stairwells into art-filled environments, with the intent of inspiring and encouraging people to walk their way towards healthier, more sustainable, and creative lives. Mouvement Art Public helped us to conceptualize, design, and implement the intervention undertaken in the north stairwell. In addition, we are presenting a series called “The City” by photographer Lori Nix, a New York artist whose constructed landscapes addresses questions around our impact on the natural environment.Contact usDownload our annual reportsRead our newsletter© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityInitiatives & programsJohn Molson School of Business
