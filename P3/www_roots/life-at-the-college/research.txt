http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/research/centres/david-obrien/research.htmlOur faculty and student research include corporate social responsibility, sustainable financial systems, ESG (environmental, social, governance), SRI (socially responsible investments), sustainability, climate change, environmental crisis management, and ecopreneurship.The David O’Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise (DOCSE) accepts proposals that use a variety of theoretical frameworks and disciplinary perspectives, methodological tools, and epistemic stances.The 2016-2017 call for grant applications is closed. Please visit this page next year for updates.All proposals must have a full-time JMSB faculty member as the primary investigator. Other full time Concordia faculty members, as well as JMSB part time faculty members and students are eligible to apply as co-applicants with a JMSB faculty member. Students must be in good academic standing (minimum 3.0 GPA).We also encourage already funded post-doctoral candidates to think of this program as an opportunity to work with sustainability researchers at Concordia University through longer than 8-week duration stays.Inquiries and proposals should be sent to the Centre Director, Dr. Thomas Walker.Contact usRead our newsletterJoin our mailing list© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityOur researchJohn Molson School of Business
