http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/volunteering/award/nominate-individual.htmlSelection CriteriaGuidelines for NominationsThe Award committee’s first focus is on the nominee’s current involvements.  We also take into account the nominee’s history of volunteering over time.  With this in mind, we encourage you to consult with the nominee prior to making your nomination, in order to obtain relevant information about their current and past volunteer roles. Your nomination letter should not exceed 2 pages in length.  It should elaborate the reasons why you believe the nominee is an outstanding volunteer.  Provide concrete examples that illustrate the extent of the nominee’s involvement as well as his/her impact on the community.If you are not the person to whom the nominee reports in his/her role as a volunteer, we encourage you to strengthen the nomination by contacting one of his/her volunteer supervisor to ask them to provide a letter of support.  Unlike your own letter of nomination, this letter is optional, but recommended.Note that it is not possible to receive both a Concordia Volunteer Award and a CCSL Outstanding Contribution Award or Engaged Scholar Award in the same year.Nomination deadlineThe nomination period of the 2016 Volunteer Awards has now ended.  The nomination period of the 2017 Awards will open in the Fall of 2016.  Stay tuned!  Questions?Contact us.  (514) 848-2424, ext. 5578volunteer@concordia.caFollow the LIVE CentreSir George Williams Campus
