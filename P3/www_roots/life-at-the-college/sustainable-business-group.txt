http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/student-life/associations-clubs/sustainable-business-group.htmlThe mission of John Molson Sustainable Business Group (JSG) is to provide students at the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) with the resources to effectively and professionally incorporate sustainability in their pursuit of becoming ecologically aware, socially just, and economically responsible business leaders. JSG is unique in its approach of combining business students from the undergraduate and graduate levels as its executive board. The array of sustainability resources offered by JSG include, amongst others, company tours, speaker series, collaboration with case competitions, and of course its annual Sustainable Business Conference.

The John Molson Sustainable Business Group holds several events throughout the year to educate and inspire students about how to make sustainable business decisions, now and in their future careers.

JSG believes that true change will come from business leaders, who use many of the world's resources. Students are the leaders of tomorrow and we want to help shape positive, lasting habits early on.

JSG also work closely with JMSB's Career Management Services (CMS) to bring in interesting speakers. Through a partnership with the David O'Brien Center for Sustainable Enterprise (DOCSE), JSG hosts unique activities for the members such as a walk to raise awareness about climate change.
