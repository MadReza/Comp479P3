http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/offices/provost/ctl/2016/12/13/developing-and-refining-your-course-syllabus-.htmlA well-developed syllabus is a blueprint for a learning-centered course. In this session, participants will explore all the essential components of a course syllabus at Concordia University. In particular, this session will focus on:
1. Course objectives: how to write well-articulated course goals and objectives
2. Assessment planning: a discussion about graded activities and what weight they should carry
3. Course Policies: a discussion to help inform instructors about relevant course policies

Participants are invited (but not required) to bring along an existing or draft syllabus for this workshop.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
