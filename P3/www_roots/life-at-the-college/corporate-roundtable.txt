http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/research/centres/david-obrien/corporate-roundtable.htmlCorporations have some of the greatest ability to affect change and have an impact on creating a sustainable world community. To that end, the David O’Brien Centre for Sustainable Enterprise (DOCSE) invites corporate leaders as well as more entrepreneurial business executives into dialogues about major environmental and social issues.This allows us to learn about the steps being taken at different levels and to discern where major gaps exist. Moreover, this process provides an opportunity for green leaders to share their success and for companies to learn from their peers.If you are interested in attending one of our corporate round table events, contact us!In October 2016, DOCSE held a corporate roundtable on Sustainable Real Estate. The members of the panel consisted of a blend of practitioners and academics. The discussion started off on the topic of the latest developments in the fast-growing sustainable real estate market. Sustainable or green real estate is one of the most exciting and fastest growing sectors where the imperatives of sustainable development is firmly taking hold. Continuing DOCSE’s successful tradition of holding corporate roundtable discussions, this was the first corporate roundtable event on the topic of sustainable real estate.In May 2016, DOCSE held a roundtable on Emerging Risks. The discussion focused on the challenges of climate change, water scarcity, cybersecurity, and other emerging risks for locally and globally operating businesses. The roundtable followed the inauguration of the Caisse de Dépôt Emerging Risk Research Program earlier that year which aimed to explore the effect of emerging risks on investment returns and volatility. The roundtable discussion was led by Cary Krosinsky from Yale University and Stephen Kibsey from the Caisse de Dépôt. Many local professionals interested in sustainability and emerging risks also shared their opinions on the topic.In November 2015, DOCSE and Future Earth held a corporate roundtable on Sustainable Financial Systems. In addition to local firms, we met with representatives from the German and U.S. Consulate who provided valuable networking contacts for the roundtable. The roundtable discussion was led by pannelists Paul Shiravastava, DOCSE’s former director, and Stephen Kibsey from the Caisse de dépôt. We organized the roundtable jointly with representatives from Future Earth and the Caisse de dépôt and have established a working group of approximately thirty attendees consisting of corporate leaders, as well as entrepreneurial business executives and academics.Contact usRead our newsletterJoin our mailing list© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCorporate roundtable & shared learningJohn Molson School of Business
