These are the hallmarks of the Individualized Program (INDI). Many stellar researchers at Concordia are prepared to help you navigate new terrains of scholarship. We offer a heterogeneous community of over 100 like-minded students to welcome you into their fold.INDI was created by the School of Graduate Studies to provide space within the academy for a limited number of exceptionally capable and prepared students with specific research goals. An individualized program of study, INDI offers the possibility for research and graduate studies at both the master’s and doctoral levels in areas not covered by existing graduate programs.© Concordia UniversitySchool of Graduate Studies
