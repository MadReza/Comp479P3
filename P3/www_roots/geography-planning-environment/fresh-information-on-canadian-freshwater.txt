http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/offices/vpaer/aar/2015/10/05/fresh-information-on-canadian-freshwater.htmlCanada has one fifth of the world's freshwater and James Snider, GrDip 07, is directing a landmark project to measure and protect it.As vice president of the Freshwater program at World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF-Canada), Snider is overseeing the first centralized database of Canadian freshwater and its biggest threats.WWF-Canada recently rolled out the benchmarking project Watershed Reports: Taking the Pulse of Canada’s Rivers. The interactive website provides a timely assessment of Canada’s 25 major watersheds — the interconnected rivers, wetlands and lakes that drain into a common body of water.The user-friendly tool aims to convey information clearly, for all to understand. It appeals to scientists, recreational outdoor enthusiasts and even schoolchildren.It shows completed assessments for half of Canada’s watersheds and WWF-Canada estimates it will complete the remainder by 2017.Watershed Reports assesses the health of a water system based on water flow, water quality, bugs and fish. Seven criteria are used to rank threats: pollution, climate change, overuse of water, alteration of flows, invasive species and habitat loss and fragmentation.Concordia experience paved the waySnider says his graduate diploma in environmental assessment helped prepare him for his role as the project’s leader.“At Concordia I was lucky to get a nature conservation internship, because that served as my bridge into the not-for-profit environmental sector,” he says. “I learned hard skills and soft skills that landed me a job with WWF six months after graduating.”A teacher’s assistant while at Concordia, Snider started out at WWF-Canada as a data-crunching geographic information system analyst. Now he supervises a Canada-wide team of specialists from WWF-Canada headquarters in Toronto.Although he considers himself more of a technician than a science communicator, he engages with different types of organizations, from conservation groups to government monitoring programs.“I’m involved in projects at various levels across the country,” Snider says. “They pave the way for community programs and data collection to take place.”Canadians taking responsibility for water systemsRecently the conservation sector has been focusing on empowering individuals and groups to help with large-scale projects such as Watershed Reports.“We’re formatting a network approach,” Snider explains. He points to the importance of cross-organizational collaboration. “Citizen scientists, community groups, recreational campers and manufacturing plants all have a role to play in nature conservation.”The report’s strong foundation of data will make it easier for advocacy organizations to inform high-level decision makers in policy and best-business practices.The goal is to have all of Canada’s watersheds rated as “good condition” by 2025 — although most of the watersheds assessed so far show concerning threat levels.Watershed Reports challenges Canadians to act. Its interactive map also displays volunteering and clean-up opportunities.“We want to see a broad audience log on to Watershed Reports, from a family of recreational campers to a construction company CEO,” Snider says. “Ultimately, we hope to provide better local water management from a national online platform.”Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFresh information on Canadian freshwaterDepartment of Geography, Planning & Environment

The interactive website provides a timely assessment of Canada’s 25 major watersheds — the interconnected rivers, wetlands and lakes that drain into a common body of water.The user-friendly tool aims to convey information clearly, for all to understand. It appeals to scientists, recreational outdoor enthusiasts and even schoolchildren.It shows completed assessments for half of Canada’s watersheds and WWF-Canada estimates it will complete the remainder by 2017.Watershed Reports assesses the health of a water system based on water flow, water quality, bugs and fish. Seven criteria are used to rank threats: pollution, climate change, overuse of water, alteration of flows, invasive species and habitat loss and fragmentation.Concordia experience paved the waySnider says his graduate diploma in environmental assessment helped prepare him for his role as the project’s leader.“At Concordia I was lucky to get a nature conservation internship, because that served as my bridge into the not-for-profit environmental sector,” he says. “I learned hard skills and soft skills that landed me a job with WWF six months after graduating.”A teacher’s assistant while at Concordia, Snider started out at WWF-Canada as a data-crunching geographic information system analyst. Now he supervises a Canada-wide team of specialists from WWF-Canada headquarters in Toronto.Although he considers himself more of a technician than a science communicator, he engages with different types of organizations, from conservation groups to government monitoring programs.“I’m involved in projects at various levels across the country,” Snider says. “They pave the way for community programs and data collection to take place.”Canadians taking responsibility for water systemsRecently the conservation sector has been focusing on empowering individuals and groups to help with large-scale projects such as Watershed Reports.“We’re formatting a network approach,” Snider explains. He points to the importance of cross-organizational collaboration. “Citizen scientists, community groups, recreational campers and manufacturing plants all have a role to play in nature conservation.”The report’s strong foundation of data will make it easier for advocacy organizations to inform high-level decision makers in policy and best-business practices.The goal is to have all of Canada’s watersheds rated as “good condition” by 2025 — although most of the watersheds assessed so far show concerning threat levels.Watershed Reports challenges Canadians to act. Its interactive map also displays volunteering and clean-up opportunities.“We want to see a broad audience log on to Watershed Reports, from a family of recreational campers to a construction company CEO,” Snider says. “Ultimately, we hope to provide better local water management from a national online platform.”Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFresh information on Canadian freshwaterDepartment of Geography, Planning & Environment
