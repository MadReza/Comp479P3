http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/geography-planning-environment/programs/undergraduate/urban-studies-planning.htmlThe BA Major Urban Studies and BA Specialization Urban Planning are multidisciplinary programs designed to introduce the students to the processes of planned change in urban environments. Urban Planning provides courses involving field studies, planning projects and the acquisition of technical skills. The programs provide a foundation for further studies in planning or related fields and training for work in the planning, real estate, and social service fields. A transfer into BA Urban Planning (Specialization) from another program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7 on a 4.3 scale. The BA Urban Planning (Honours) requires the completion of a thesis based on research carried out by the student under the supervision of a professor. Transfer into the Honours program requires a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 on a 4.3 scale.Concordia University has a number of official exchange agreements with universities abroad. For example, the agreement with the University of Dundee in Scotland has allowed Concordia students to study there for one year while paying Québec tuition fees. The year of study there can be fully credited toward a year of study (30 credits) at Concordia. Study abroad should only be contemplated in the second year of a three-year program.Under a global exchange agreement covering all Québec universities, it is also possible to undertake a year of study in a French university and have these studies fully credited toward the Bachelor's degree at Concordia. Each case will be examined separately. French universities charge modest tuition fees but students are expected to be fully self-supporting. German universities will also accommodate visiting students but it will be necessary to pass a German language proficiency test upon arrival. Concordia International has an expanding roster of universities which can be attended by Concordia students.Visit Concordia International for a listing of our current partner institutions.The planning collections of the four universities in Montreal are accessible to Concordia students. Journals are sometimes carried by more than one institution but many journals are only available at one university. Undergraduate students may borrow only from Concordia University but you may consult the extensive collections at, for example, Blackader-Lauterman Library at McGill or the Bibliothèque de l'aménagement at the Université de Montréal.Urban Studies students may also become student members of the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Membership will grant you discounts on purchases and entry to the Centre. You may also visit (and browse) their excellent bookstore. You may also arrange to consult documents in the specialized library of the CCA.McGill's bookstore also carries an interesting range of titles. One of the better bookstores carrying planning and architecture titles is Olivieri.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityAbout Urban studies &  planningDepartment of Geography, Planning & Environment
