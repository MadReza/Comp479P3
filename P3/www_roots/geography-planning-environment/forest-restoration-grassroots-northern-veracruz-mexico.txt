http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/geography/2014/03/21/forest-restoration-grassroots-northern-veracruz-mexico.htmlTraditional agroforestry systems provide important environmental services and they may act as refuges for native fauna. Such conditions can be found in the Totonac territory in Veracruz, Mexico. By working closely with a local indigenous organization, we have put into practice ecological restoration theory. The organization has received guidance on the establishment of a nursery where native plants will be grown and studied in a 2 ha plot donated by the local government. The socio-ecological system has become resilient through autonomy, social organization and leadership strengthening, and local communities hold themselves responsible for the continuation and long term follow up of sustainable development actions in the region.Download the poster.  © Concordia UniversityConcordia University
