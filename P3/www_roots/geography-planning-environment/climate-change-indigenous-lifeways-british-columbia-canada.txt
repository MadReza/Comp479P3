http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/geography/2013/11/29/climate-change-indigenous-lifeways-british-columbia-canada.htmlIndigenous Peoples of British Columbia have always had to accommodate and respond to environmental change. Oral histories, recollections of contemporary elders, and terms in indigenous languages all reflect peoples’ responses to such change, especially since the coming of Europeans. Recently people have noted signs of greater environmental change and challenges to their resilience than they have faced in the past: species declines; new appearances; anomalies in weather; and declining  health of forests and grasslands. These observations and perspectives are important to include in discussions and considerations of global climate change.Download the poster.  © Concordia UniversityConcordia University
