http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/research/centres/water-energy.htmlThe Concordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems (CIWESS) trains students to be at the forefront of sustainable development practices. It promotes research into new systems, technologies and solutions for water, energy and resource conservation. While the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science is the home base of the Institute, under Director Catherine Mulligan, the Institute's activities will eventually include all of Concordia's four faculties and will also provide opportunities for collaborations with industry and communities.The Institute was made possible through the generous support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). On June 26, 2012, NSERC announced that Concordia University had received $1.64 million through its CREATE program (Collaborative Research and Training Experience) in support of research and training programs conducted via the new Institute.April 10, 2014
