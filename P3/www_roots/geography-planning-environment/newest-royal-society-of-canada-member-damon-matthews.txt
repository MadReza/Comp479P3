http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2016/09/13/newest-royal-society-of-canada-member-damon-matthews.htmlHow much time is left to avoid dangerous climate change impacts?This is the question to which Damon Matthews, Concordia University Research Chair for Climate Science and Sustainability and professor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment, has dedicated himself for well over a decade.Considered a leader in his field, Matthews researches climate systems, climate change and environmental modelling. Now this work has earned him a top national honour — membership in the Royal Society of Canada’s College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists.Formed in 2014 to recognize intellectual leaders and pioneers in Canada from a variety of fields, the college already boasts the membership of four Concordia researchers — Steven High, Erin Manning and Vincent Martin were included in the inaugural cohort, and Muthukumaran Packirisamy was inducted last year. Matthews is immensely honoured to represent Concordia within the college.“This is a fantastic opportunity to meet and interact with a group of really interesting young scholars and researchers,” Matthews says. “I’m especially grateful to Concordia for their role in putting my nomination forward — this university has been a wonderful environment in which to build my academic career, and I would like to thank the many people here who have supported me both personally and professionally.”Through his research, Matthews has shown how each emission of carbon dioxide leads to a discrete and essentially irreversible increase in world temperatures. This work has improved understandings of the science of climate change, its impacts on human and environmental systems and how best to respond to the challenge of climate mitigation.“Recognition from a prestigious body like the Royal Society of Canada is extremely gratifying,” says Graham Carr, interim provost and vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies. “The fact that Concordia faculty members continue to receive this honour is a further demonstration of the important contributions that our research makes to the betterment of Canadian society.”Concordia is also the institutional sponsor of the College, a tribute to the university's commitment to next-generation researchers.
