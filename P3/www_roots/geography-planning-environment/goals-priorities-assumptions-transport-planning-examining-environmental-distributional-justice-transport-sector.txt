This talk presents a recent case study examining the equity of the distribution of benefits of a transport system. Between 1996 and 2006 Toronto saw important improvements and expansions in rail, subway, and highway infrastructure. At the same time, the region experienced rapid population growth as well as intra-regional migration and shifts in the locations of jobs.This study seeks to understand the distribution of the benefits offered by these transport improvements across space and socio-economic status and explores how a just distribution of regional accessibility can be defined, measured, and visualized.Download the poster.  © Concordia UniversityConcordia University
