http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/geography-planning-environment/research/centres/trip-lab.htmlThe Transportation Research for Integrated Planning (TRIP) Lab was founded in October 2011 as part of a Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grant associated with a Tier-II Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land-use Linkages for Regional Sustainability. The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and statistical analysis.Research in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city. Recently, a smartphone application (DataMobile) has been developed to conduct origin-destination of members of the Concordia community.Research on urban transportation at Concordia:Zachary Patterson (Ph.D. McGill, 2007)
