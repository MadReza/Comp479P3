While Concordia is heading the undertaking, partners from McGill’s SKILLSETS program will provide input throughout the development process.“McGill has different programs and approaches, so looking at the needs of their students along with ours gives us more perspective in understanding the general needs of research students at the PhD level and helps us further assess the job market,” says Kathleen Boies, an associate professor of management in the John Molson School of Business and Concordia University Research Chair in Leadership Development, who is heading the project alongside Martin.“The more heads the better when developing programs and content, so we’ll benefit from their expertise.”The new research leadership program is set to launch in September 2016, with GradProSkills holding a number of pilot workshops this spring. Check out GradProSkills’ mostly-free workshops for graduate students.
