It is a parity committee made of equal numbers of students and staff and faculty. CCSL meets once per month during the academic year to discuss a variety of student life topics, disperse funding to student-led initiatives, and recognize outstanding individuals at Concordia.The Concordia Council on Student Life (CCSL) makes funds available to support projects that enhance or contribute to the quality of student life at Concordia.The Big Hairy Ideas was a one time competition held in 2015-2016 that looked for projects that inspire Concordians, have a deep and broad community impact and are collaborations between students and staff and/or faculty. Take a look at the winners and what they have in store for 2016-2017!CCSL Awards recognize individuals (students, staff or faculty) who have gone above and beyond their duties to enhance the quality of life at Concordia.
