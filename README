Comp 479 Project3 - Web crawler & Sentiment Analysis

notes:
    The some of the crawled folders are bigger then the set size of 2MB,
    but trust that it works now, those were crawled prior to the soft-cap
    (they make for some test data, but we will recrawl one shot before the demo)

todo:
- finish sentiment analysis?
- make sure we answer all the questions
- Do the mystery page


done:
- install scrapy
- crawl some test data, get all links no dups
- if a root folder exceeds 1MB size stop scraping for it
