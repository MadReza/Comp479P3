EHS must also be advised if there are any significant changes (e.g., change in biological materials or procedures) to a previously approved permit.For assistance in determining the required level of containment, please contact Frédéric Guilhem at extension 7334 or Lorena Boju  at extension 5008.EHS must be notified at least 5 working days prior to the scheduled transfer to ensure transfer compliance.In case of an international transfer, EHS will prepare and provide necessary paperwork to be used by Canada Border Services Agency, to avoid seizure and/or destruction of the biological material.For assistance with the transfer of biological materials from or to Concordia University, please consult this document.
