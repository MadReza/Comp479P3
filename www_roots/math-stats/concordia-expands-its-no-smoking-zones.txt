In the latest edition of its Smoke-Free Environment Policy, Concordia has instituted new smoking restrictions that will see the nine-metre smoke-free zone expanded to include areas around windows that open and building air intakes — in addition to all entrances.The revised policy, which takes effect on November 26, is designed to bring Concordia in line with the Government of Quebec’s Tobacco Control Act. This act aims to protect the public from second-hand smoke, encourage smokers to quit, protect young people and prevent youth from taking up smoking.In the coming month, stickers will be placed on university doors, around buildings and in front of ventilation systems to define the new smoke-free zones.Although Concordia will not fine individuals in violation of this policy, those caught smoking in a prohibited place by city officials can face penalties from $250 to $750.Visitors and members of the Concordia community are urged to simply step further away from university buildings in these new locations.Looking to quit? Concordia Health Services provides students, staff and faculty with free one-on-one smoking cessation counselling from health promotion specialists.
