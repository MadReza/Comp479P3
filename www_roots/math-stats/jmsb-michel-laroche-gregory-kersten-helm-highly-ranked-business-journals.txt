A pair of professors from the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) have landed the top editorial positions at two leading peer-reviewed journals.Marketing professor Michel Laroche was named editor-in-chief of the Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences, while Gregory Kersten, professor in the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management, has been appointed to the same position for the Journal of Group Decision and Negotiation.The Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences is a multi-disciplinary business journal that publishes papers on marketing, strategic management and international business, accounting, finance, organizational behaviour and human resources management. It's the most influential business journal in Canada according to the Scimago Journal and Country Rank.“I consider it an honour to have been named editor-in-chief,” says Laroche, who holds a Royal Bank Distinguished Professorship in Marketing and has significant editorial experience.“The articles that are published in this journal make a substantial contribution to knowledge creation in areas that are relevant to the Canadian environment.”The Journal of Group Decision and Negotiation explores computer group decision and negotiation support systems, artificial intelligence and management science and applied game theory, among other topics. It's ranked in the top quartile of business, management and accounting journals globally for its scientific influence.Kersten, an expert in conflict resolution in physical and virtual environments, as well as individual and group decision-making, holds the Tier 1 Concordia University Research Chair in Decision and Negotiation Systems and is a founder of the InterNeg Research Centre, hosted at JMSB.As editors-in-chief, the professors will be responsible for overseeing the academic operations of their respective journals, assigning manuscripts to associate editors and making the final decisions on manuscripts. They will also be managing budgets and relationships with publishers and the granting agencies.Stéphane Brutus, interim dean of JMSB, says the school is tremendously proud to be hosting the highly ranked journals. “These editorial appointments are yet another example of our rising research profile.”
