http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/financial-support/budgeting/banking-and-financialinstitutions.htmlAn important part of money management is making sure that you understand the importance of banking. Some of you didn’t open a chequing account while you were still living and studying at home. At that stage, a basic savings account is likely to be all you needed - as a home for hard-saved money, like birthday and Christmas cash gifts.  But now that you’re at university you'll almost certainly need an account with more services and options to help you pay your way in the world. Shop around to find the best account for your needs. Most banks and credit unions are happy to offer student accounts - they hope you'll stick with them for life, as many people do. Student accounts usually have no fees or very low fees with unlimited debit transactions and perks designed to appeal to students. Banks can include a range of incentives to sign up, such as free CDs, MP3’s or discounts on movies and travel. However, before you sign up just because you're attracted by a free MP3, think about what you need from a current account. Most accounts will provide some services as a minimum, but there may be some specific requirements that could make a big difference to you, like access to a student banking advisor or provide loans for postgraduate training.  Financial Aid & Awards Office© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityBanking and financial institutionsStudent hub
