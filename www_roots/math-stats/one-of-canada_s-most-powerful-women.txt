http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/offices/vpaer/aar/2016/07/12/one-of-canada_s-most-powerful-women.html“I have a natural inclination towards analytics and numbers,” says Miriam Pozza, BA (Statistics) 90. That ability has certainly helped her in her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) LLP in Montreal.
 
Her experience and expertise has also led Miriam to be named a recipient of the Women’s Executive Network’s (WXN) 2015 Canada’s Most Powerful Women: Top 100 Awards. She was honoured at a gala hosted by the WXN at The Westin Montreal in April.“It’s always nice to have recognition when you put effort into your work, your personal development and the development of your team,” she says. At Concordia, Pozza studied in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. “I was interested in anything that had to do with numbers and understanding our economy through numbers,” she says. “That’s what led me to the world of finance.”Pozza joined the professional services network of PwC in 1991.She says that her passion in assisting entrepreneurs and corporations in their growth has led her into the world of mergers and acquisitions.She’s worked determinedly to distinguish herself in this competitive field.
 
After spending several years in both the auditing and valuation departments — eventually receiving designations as a Chartered Professional Accountant and Chartered Business Valuator — Pozza became Deals leader for the Quebec Region in 2013.
 
Her main function, she explains, is to help her colleagues work together towards the common goal of accompanying clients in their transactions. Aspects of the job that she finds particularly rewarding are the challenges of completing a deal, and helping companies grow to meet their full potential.
 
Pozza says her commitment to personal and professional development, coupled with her natural leadership qualities, has made her an important asset to the various organizations she has supported throughout her career.
 
“If you view yourself as fortunate, and I do, I think giving back to the community is rewarding,” she says.
 
For 10 years, Pozza lent her accounting skills to the YWCA Montreal by acting as a treasurer on its board of directors. She also sits on the fundraising committee of La Fondation Armand-Frappier, a research institute in the life sciences sector.
 
“Medicine and wellbeing were always something that I found of great interest,” she says, adding that her ambition was to become a doctor when she was younger.
 
Pozza also supports the advancement of women to leadership positions through her directorship with the Quebec Association of Women in Finance (AFFQ). In 2012, the AFFQ awarded her the Recognition Award for her tireless dedication.“I find it important to be part of this association and to specifically assist women in their development, by helping them build a network and develop their skills,” she says.
 
Described previously by PwC CEO Bill McFarland as a natural mentor, Pozza believes strongly that building a network of mentors helps women develop their careers in the long run.
 
The best mentors, she says, will take an interest in your values and guide you out of your comfort zone. “Sometimes you need that little push to take some risks.”Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityOne of Canada’s most powerful womenDepartment of Mathematics & Statistics
