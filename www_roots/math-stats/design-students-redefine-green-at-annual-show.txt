“My students learn that everything in the built environment has an impact,” says Assistant Professor Carmela Cucuzzella, who specializes in sustainable design. “They soon realize that their actions can make a difference and they find ways to rise to the challenge.”Graduating students who have spent time at Concordia exploring sustainable design practices and ethical technologies will have their work on display at the annual exhibition, this year titled WRAPT/EMBALLÉ, from April 25 to 28 and again on May 4 and 5, as part of the Portes Ouvertes Design Montréal event.

Associate Professor Martin Racine, whose class organized the exhibition, explains how the department’s holistic, experimental and collaborative way of working extends to the show, which includes interior design, graphic design and interactive media.

“Students create the theme, plan the layout, and develop the website and accompanying poster and plan all the interactive activites,” he says.

Courses in the department, including Racine’s, encompass the areas of visual communication, product and space design, and visual media, all within the context of social, economic and environmental sustainability.
A lecture by Brian MacKay-Lyons, a partner at MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects, will precede the WRAPT/EMBALLÉ vernissage on April 25. MacKay-Lyons is a world leader in regionalist architecture, with a commitment to cultural sustainability and environmental stewardship.

Both the lecture and the vernissage are open to the public and are free of charge.
