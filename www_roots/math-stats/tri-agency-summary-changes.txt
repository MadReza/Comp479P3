As such, Concordia University created account codes with a customized Research benefit rate that captures non-discretionary benefits only. The Research benefit rates are linked to the 666* “Research salary” account code series.  The Research salaries account code series must be used in order to apply the CU customized Research benefit rate and therefore comply with the Tri-Agency rules.http://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/services/financial/docs/Benefit_Rates_for_2016-2017.pdfNote: Any account code used that generates a benefit rate greater than -the current Research benefit rate of  21.4% is deemed ineligible by the Tri Agency as this would include discretionary benefits.Salaries on Tri-Agency grantsAny individual whose status would make them eligible to apply for a Tri-Agency grant cannot be paid any part of his/her salary/stipend on any Tri- Agency grant.Exception:Postdoctoral researchers holding a fellowship or receiving a stipend or salary from another researcher’s grant may apply for and hold their own research grant (SSHRC only).Please review the Summary of Changes  on the tri-Agency website, which highlights these & other significant updates at:http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Professors-Professeurs/FinancialAdminGuide-GuideAdminFinancier/TFAGChange-GAFTRevision_eng.aspIf there are any questions please contact your financial officer in Restricted Funds.Thank you.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCommunication to Researchers - Tri-Agency Summary of ChangesRelated topicsFind an expertConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
