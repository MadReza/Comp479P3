http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/sustainability/sustainability-initiatives/energy.htmlFaced with the global and local challenges of climate change, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cleaner energy consumption. At Concordia, the focus is on ensuring that all buildings are as energy efficient as possible while providing adequate services to the community.Greenhouse Gas InventoryConcordia University is committed towards minimizing its greenhouse gas emissions level (i.e. “carbon footprint”) through different initiatives such as increased energy efficiency of operations and cleaner energy consumption.Concordia’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory includes direct emissions (e.g. heating fuel consumption), indirect emissions (e.g. electricity production and transmission, commuting, landfill waste) and qualitative analysis to raise awareness on potential sources of emissions.Emissions were reduced by 7% from 2010-11 to 2014-15. A large part of this was because the university switched some equipment operating on natural gas to electric operated systems.  For more information please consult the report below:2014-15 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report [PDF - 689 KB]More information related to energy efficiency initiatives at Concordia:More sustainability initiatives related to energy have been implemented at Concordia University; many of which have been led by Facilities Management’s Engineering and Building Performance team.
