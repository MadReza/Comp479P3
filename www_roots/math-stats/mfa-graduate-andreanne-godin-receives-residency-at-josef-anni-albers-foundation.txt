 This summer, Concordia graduate and visual artist Andréanne Godin (MFA 13) was selected for a two-month residency at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation in Bethany, Connecticut.Created in 1971, the foundation aims to preserve and promote the aesthetic principles of the artistic couple, who were pioneers of 20th-century modernism. Residencies are awarded annually to those “who exemplify the seriousness of purpose that the artists characterized.”Godin’s art explores the possibilities of an expanded practice of drawing. Here she reflects on her Connecticut experience:A steep slope surrounded by lush forest guided me down to two wooden houses. On my left, a pond unfolded itself behind a ramshackle fenced garden, with its island and lily pads. I slowed down to take everything in, the calmness of the scene, the shimmering water and the slight breeze; all were telling me that I would cherish this experience for a long time. 
 
Further along this gravel road I stumbled on a green sign which read, “This is Orange.” The humourous reference to the importance of colour in both Anni and Josef’s work, the fact that they used to live in the county of Orange and the idea that we were allowed into this intimate place where we could have access to remnants of their lives and work made me smile. Created by Nick Murphy, director of the Senegalese residency project Thread and a staff member at the foundation, this piece had the power to confirm that I was exactly where I was supposed to be.Greeted by Fritz Horstman, the artist-in-residence and education coordinator, I toured the main office, which consists of two joint buildings of completely different natures. The first looks like a bucolic wood barn while the second of minimal concrete construction stands strong and tall.The colliding buildings contain a superb library of modernist-focused books, many of which are rare. They also house the written archives of both Anni and Josef’s private and public correspondence, gallery space, several offices with incredibly skilled, generous and lovely staff and finally, an imposing archival storage space. All these treasures were accessible to me for the length of my residency.
 
Driving by another beautiful building where Josef’s furniture and Anni’s looms were kept, I saw the studio. Because it resembled a cottage from the outside, I was not expecting the intensity of the emotion that would suddenly flow as Fritz opened its door. A mix of excitement, profound joy and relief arose in me. I felt like I was home, like they had thought of me when building this place.I was given the James and Lillian Clark studio. Built in 2001 for the foundation’s first residents, the 400-square-foot space has windows that climb 16 feet high to a cathedral roof. I would often climb up the two flights of stairs to get to the room from which I could look down on my work and really see. At the back of the house, a protected veranda allowed me to be amongst nature with the calming sounds of the forest constantly reminding me of its presence. It was the perfect space to stop, read, think and make. Over the course of my stay at the foundation, I had the time to reflect on my work as much as on myself — meeting and exchanging with incredible artists, administrators, curators, but above all, passionate, giving and lovely people.Throughout the residency my work and mind were obviously challenged by solitude and doubt, but I slowly discovered ways to emerge from them. I found strength and peace in places that I would never have expected and wish that other artists could also experience the same.
The deadline for next year’s residency application to the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation is January 1, 2017. Applications can be submitted here.Find out more about Concordia’s Faculty of Fine Arts.
