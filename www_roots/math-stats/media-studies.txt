http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/media-studies.htmlTraditional and emerging media technologies and platforms affect the way we perceive the world and our place in it. As producers and consumers of different forms of media, we are actively participating in an environment that gives agency to certain individuals, groups and movements over others. Now more than ever, we need academic researchers and creators to examine the social, political and cultural dimensions of various forms of media.The MA in Media Studies provides you with an environment to further your command of contemporary media culture, history and theory. Our renowned faculty members will supply you with an interdisciplinary formation to media studies that integrates knowledge based in the humanities, liberal arts, social sciences and fine arts.Our students benefit from an exceptionally active research culture led by a multitude of faculty research initiatives and creations. This vibrant setting will encourage and challenge you to pursue your own research interests in areas as varied as community activism, video games and feminist media.Our MA students are looking at topics such as:You may choose one of four options:Option IResearch and thesis: an independent, supervised thesis project of 20,000 to 25,000 words in length and submitted in written form at the end of the second year.Option IICourse work only: for students interested in advancing their professional or vocational development.Option IIIResearch-creation project: students with significant media production experience can undertake a research-creation project deploying one or more media forms, comprising an original media production or prototype in any genre and a 10,000 word document. The program does not provide media training.Option IVMajor research paper: an extended 10,000 word essay or project on a topic chosen in consultation with a full-time faculty member.Admission Requirements. Normally the candidate must have a bachelor’s degree in communication (or equivalent in a cognate area) with a minimum of 3.00 GPA. Experience in media or a media-related field is an asset.
