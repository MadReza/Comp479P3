Hardware devices called keyloggers, which can capture computer keystrokes, were recently found on some of Concordia's standing express workstations in the Webster and Vanier libraries. These computers are available for public use for a maximum of 10 minutes.In response, the university launched a thorough investigation, including the inspection of all public desktop computer workstations on both campuses. Concordia also filed a report with the Service de police de la Ville de Montréal (SPVM).The expertise of the university's library and IITS staff was instrumental in detecting and mitigating this situation.The integrity of the 272 laptops on loan and 432 library workstations, networks and the security of Concordia's IT system remain intact.The hardware keyloggers were only found on express workstations located on LB2 in the Webster Library (these computers were located on LB2 until February 2016 and are now on LB3), and on express workstations located in the Vanier Library on VL1.These keylogger devices can capture personal data such as login information and passwords (for example, passwords associated with your Concordia netname) by tracking the keystrokes used at a workstation.No other hardware devices were discovered on other publicly available computer workstations at the university. Laptop computers and tablets, available for loan from the libraries’ circulation desk, are not affected because hardware keyloggers cannot capture keystrokes from this equipment (up-to-date antivirus programs can usually detect software keyloggers).Concordia is taking proactive measures to increase security where public computer workstations are located. The university is conducting regular visual inspections and implementing several other measures that include educating students, faculty and staff.With the information available to date, Concordia strongly advises that, as a precautionary measure, if you used one of the standing express workstations in either the Webster or Vanier library within the last 12 months, you should:
