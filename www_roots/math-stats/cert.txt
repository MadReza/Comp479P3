http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/campus-life/emergency/cert.htmlThe Concordia Emergency Response Team (CERT) is made up of staff and student volunteers that assist during evacuations and other emergencies that may occur on campus.As a student, volunteering with CERT requires very little commitment and looks great on a resume. All we ask is that you take the required training and help while you are on campus. There are no shifts or off campus commitments.  Team members go about their regular activities on campus and only assume their CERT responsibility in the event of an emergency in the building you are in.As a CERT member your primary duties will be during a building evacuation or for a Shelter in Place emergency. You may also be called upon for other emergencies such as first-aid or to support emergency operations during a disaster.  You are only expected to respond if you are on campus and in the building implicated.During a building evacuation:To become a CERT member you must take the 4 hour CERT orientation training.  Once completed, you will be an active CERT member and start assiting during emergencies.  You will then have 12 months to complete the 2 other mandatory trainings;  Check for the next available training.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia Emergency Response Team volunteers (CERT)The Role of CERTI want to join CERTConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
