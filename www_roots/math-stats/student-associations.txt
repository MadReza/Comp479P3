http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/theatre/student-life/student-associations.htmlCAST, the Concordia Association of Students in Theatre, works to support and enrich the experience of students in Concordia’s Department of Theatre. We do so by planning and hosting community-building activities—from cabarets to brunches to workshops with guest artists—and by acting as a resource organization through which students can seek information, raise questions or concerns and share their experience with other members of the Concordia Theatre community.All students in the Department of Theatre are members of CAST. We invite you all to become active members by attending our weekly meetings, held in the CAST office in room 510 of the GM Building.Contact C.A.S.TVisit the website© Concordia UniversityAbout the department
