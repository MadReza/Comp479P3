http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2016/11/14/warning-siren-test-planned-near-loyola-campus.htmlOn Thursday, November 17, between 2:00 and 2:30 p.m., the City of Montreal is holding an emergency exercise that involves testing a warning siren for three minutes. The siren will be heard in the west-end of Montreal, including the Loyola Campus.The city regularly works with local companies using hazardous materials to reduce the risks associated with major industrial accidents.The test is being done in cooperation with Parmalat Canada Inc., an industrial company that uses ammonia as a coolant to keep products at the proper temperatures. The goal is to test the company’s warning equipment and its emergency team's response.The siren test will send out a rising and falling tone that will last three minutes. Note: there is no action required on your part.Since sound is influenced by weather conditions, there is a possibility that the siren will be barely audible in some locations of the targeted area.In the case of a major industrial accident, the warning siren would be immediately activated to advise residents of a dangerous situation within 1860 metres of the plant. At Concordia, our emergency notification system would be used, if required.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityNov. 17: Warning siren test planned near Loyola CampusRelated topicsFind an expertConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
