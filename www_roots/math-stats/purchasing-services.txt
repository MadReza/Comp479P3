http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/financial-services/departments/purchasing-services.htmlThe Mission of the Purchasing Services department is to acquire goods and services for the University Community in such a manner as to maximize the value to the University Community in considering price, quality, service availability, and operational performance.A purchase decision is normally the result of a process which includes identifying a need, the consideration of alternatives and ultimately the selection of the product or service that offers the best value to the community.Purchasing Services buyers, in addition to the responsibility to make purchases for goods and services on behalf of University faculty members and administrative and support staff, offer assistance at the various stages leading to a decision to purchase. The process of acquiring goods and services is recognized by the University as being fundamental to its efficient operation and often represents significant legal and financial commitments by the University.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityPurchasing ServicesJoin the ConversationMandateContact usConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
