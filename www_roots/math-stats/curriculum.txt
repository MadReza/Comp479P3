Provotrack allows users to revise their dossiers as they are presented throughout the process, and proposals are retained in a database management system.Provotrack requires users to have a login code and password which can be requested from Olivia Ward in the Office of the Vice-Provost, Teaching and Learning.Curriculum proposals submitted to the Academic Programs Committee (APC) include changes to existing programs and courses, as well as proposals for new undergraduate and graduate programs. Separate guideline documents for undergraduate and graduate proposals outline the curriculum flow from creation in the department/unit through to Senate approval. Each document also includes a flowchart of the internal process and a brief summary of the procedures for new programs being submitted to the BCI (formerly CREPUQ) and MELS. The full BCI and MELS procedural documents can be found under the External Resources heading.All proposals must be created using Concordia's curriculum processing tool, Provotrack (see above).
