The Sustainable Event Guide was developed by the student group Sustainable Concordia to help you find the resources and services to make your events as sustainable as possible. It is a document filled with guidance, resources, and simple advice about organizing an event that benefits the community, promotes ethical purchasing, and reduces waste.In 2014, Concordia University was the host of the 82nd Congrès de l’Acfas. As this event involved about 5000 researchers from over the world, sustainability initiatives made this event as sustainable as logistically possible.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversitySustainability eventsFeatured eventsIntegrating sustainability in your eventsConferencesConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424The Sustainable Event Guide82e Congrès de l’Acfas
