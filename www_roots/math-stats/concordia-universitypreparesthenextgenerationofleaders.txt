The Board of Governors has given the go-ahead for the John Molson School of Business to launch a new Executive MBA (EMBA) designed to train the complete executive through an innovative program that will go well beyond the mastery of traditional academic subjects. The revamped EMBA program also includes professional/leadership coaching, a health and fitness program designed for executives, and solid links to the business community.“We are enhancing our rigorous academic program by adding unique elements that will ensure our EMBA graduates are ready on all facets to meet the challenges of today’s rapidly evolving business environments,” says Steve Harvey, dean of the JMSB.The new EMBA, to start in the fall of 2014, will be based on an integrative learning model where one theme will be examined per term. Under this model, issues will be scrutinized to consider their implications from a marketing, management, finance, accounting and information technology point of view. In addition, each term includes an experiential component in the form of competitive case analyses, an international study trip, speaker series and other events involving prominent members of the business community.“Regular contact with today’s business leaders will allow students in the new John Molson EMBA program to stay ahead of the game,” says Stéphane Brutus, associate dean of Graduate Professional Programs at the JMSB. “These networking opportunities will expose our students to the big picture through real-world business practices honed by the best in the industry.”A novel component of the program involves each cohort being paired with a champion, a well-respected business leader who will remain in contact with the group throughout the two-year program. The champion for the program’s first cohort will be Andrew Molson, partner and chairman of RES PUBLICA Consulting Group and vice-chairman of the board of Molson Coors.With the aim of training the complete executive, the new EMBA program will also explore the mind/body connection by drawing on the expertise of the university’s PERFORM Centre. The centre’s professionals will offer personalized health and fitness advice designed for the busy executive as well as access to PERFORM’s state-of-the-art workout facilities. To further enable students to perform at the peak of their mental and physical capacity, they will also be given leadership and professional development training by certified professional coaches.Read more about the new John Molson EMBA program
