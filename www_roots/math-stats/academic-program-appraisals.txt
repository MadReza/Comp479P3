The criteria for program appraisal are based on the following five principles adopted by the Concordia University Senate:Recommendations from the Implementation Plan provide a basis for academic planning, which is subsequently approved by the Faculty, School of Graduate Studies and Senate.The Concordia University Academic Program Appraisals Manual, 5th edition revised (November 2015), was designed for use by the departments and academic units under appraisal. It includes information and guidelines for every step of the appraisal process.The Appraisal Coordinator will make Word templates available to the departments and units responsible for preparing reports as part of the appraisal. For a copy of the DAC Report template and additional guidelines, please visit CSpace.The results of the appraisal process for the 2011-2017 cycle will be made available to the University community as they become available. A summary of strengths and recommendations for remedy of weaknesses where appropriate, as reported by the Faculty Dean's Implementation Plan, will be posted on this website for public scrutiny.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityAcademic Program AppraisalsContact usRelated LinksNewsMore about the appraisal process
