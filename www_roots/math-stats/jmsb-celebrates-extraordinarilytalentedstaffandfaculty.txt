When asked for the key to John Molson School of Business’s success, Dean Steve Harvey’s answer is simple: “We have extraordinarily talented people doing their jobs well.”

On December 11, Harvey and his colleagues honoured six of those people — three faculty members and three staff members — at the annual JMSB Dean’s Awards.
The awards were established in 2008 to recognize exceptional faculty members for their scholarly and teaching achievements, and staff members who have distinguished themselves through the support services they offer.Among this year’s honourees were the Department of Management’s Raymond Paquin, who received the Emerging Scholar Award; the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management’s Satyaveer Chauhan, winner of the Mid-Scholar Award; and the Department of Marketing’s Michèle Paulin, who took home the Full-Time Undergraduate Award.The three staff recognition awards went to the Department of Finance’s Edite Almeida, the Department of Supply Chain and Business Technology Management’s Eva Ferrara and the Undergraduate Programs Office’s Mary Laliotis.Harvey also took the opportunity to announce that Michel Magnan, a professor in the Department of Accountancy and the former Lawrence Bloomberg Endowed Chair in Accountancy, has been awarded the Stephen A. Jarislowsky Chair in Corporate Governance. The chair was established by the Jarislowsky Foundation to promote research and teaching in the area of corporate governance.Wondering where the John Molson School of Business stands internationally?
