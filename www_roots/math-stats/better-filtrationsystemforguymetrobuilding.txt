The Guy-Metro (GM) Building’s central cooling plant is being replaced by a cleaner and greener system, along with an additional cooling system, which can be used when the entire cooling system is not required. This will be an energy saver.A new heat exchanger will allow for effective heat recovery and recycling of heat by warming incoming air. The new, durable stainless-steel cooling towers will also be considerably more efficient.Because the new cooling system will reside on the building’s roof, during the installation of the cooling system passersby will notice a crane in the laneway off De Maisonneuve Boulevard, next to the GM Building (between Guy and Mackay streets).The work is expected to wrap up mid-May.Questions?
