Coca-Cola Refreshment Canada has been named Concordia's beverage service provider for the next five years. The contract includes two one-year renewal options.The offer from Coca-Cola satisfies the quality criteria laid out in the request for proposals (RFP) and maximizes the revenue potential for the university.This announcement comes after a public tender process, a campus-wide survey that received close to 5,000 responses, and consultations with various stakeholders on campus including the Food Advisory Working Group, the same committee that determined the criteria for the new food provider contract.The group is composed of representatives from the Office of the Vice‐President of Services, the dean of Students, Hospitality Concordia, Residence Life, Health Services, one undergraduate student and one graduate student.The criteria include a commitment to having at least 25 per cent of healthful content in every vending machine, with an annual increase of three per cent for the duration of the contract.Telemetric reporting from vending machines will notify the supplier that supplies are running low and that the machine needs to be restocked. This requirement effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions by minimizing the distance travelled by the supplier to verify supply levels, sometimes unnecessarily.Additionally, all machines will also accept both credit and debit cards because, in the beverage survey that was held last fall, payment methods were found to be an important factor for students.The contract also requires that the service provider support student and community initiatives through annual student scholarships and numerous other forms of sponsorship.For any questions or comments, read the FAQ or email food.services@concordia.ca.
