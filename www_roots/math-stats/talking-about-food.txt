The results will be used to develop a public request for proposals.“I would like to thank each and every person who completed the survey. Your feedback is invaluable to us in the development of Concordia’s new food services contract,” says Sabrina Lavoie, executive director of budget planning and business development for the Office of the Vice-President of Services.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityTalking about foodNews
