http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2013/07/19/the-economist-john-molson-emba-second-among-canadian-programs.htmlThe Executive MBA program offered by Concordia’s John Molson School of Business (JMSB) came ranked 47th in the world in the first-ever EMBA ranking conducted by The Economist. The university placed second among solely Canadian contenders.

In the article accompanying the rankings, it was noted that at 41 per cent, Concordia’s program had the highest proportion of female students at surveyed schools.
 The programs were ranked according to two broad measures: personal development/educational experience and career development. The Economist collected data between February and May 2013, with two web-based questionnaires.

One was filled out by business schools; it included information about students and faculty, the number of overseas assignments required, statistics on alumni and other quantitative measures. The second was circulated to current students and alumni from schools’ last three graduating classes. More than 8,400 questionnaires were completed.
