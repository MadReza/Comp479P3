In the latest edition of its Smoke-Free Environment Policy, Concordia has officially addressed vaping and electronic cigarettes.The revised policy, which takes effect on September 1, bans the use of e-cigarettes in established non-smoking areas. It defines e-cigarettes as “any cigarette-shaped device including any vaping device containing a nicotine-based liquid or any other mixture which can be used in such devices and that is vaporized or inhaled.”Although no fines result from an infraction, visitors and members of the Concordia community will be asked to refrain from using the e-cigarette, or to simply step futher away from university buildings.With these policy revisions, Concordia has joined the majority of Quebec's universities in equating e-cigarettes with regular cigarettes.Read Concordia’s updated Smoke-Free Environment Policy. Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia’s Smoke-Free Environment Policy now includes e-cigarettesNews
