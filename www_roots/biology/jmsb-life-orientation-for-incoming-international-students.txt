The orientation includes academic workshops as well as many fun activities.• In-class ice-breaker activities
• Quebec culture: Our history and tradition
• Student Success Centre – University resources available to help you succeed
• Health Services – keeping you healthy
• Individual academic advising – What courses should I take? Am I taking the right courses?Who? What? Where? When? Why?

We know how daunting it can be arriving to a new city and to a new school. To help you transition, we have established a buddy system which involves pairing a group of international students with a group of senior local students for one term. It’s a great and fun way to get to know JMSB and Montreal more quickly and to develop cross-cultural friendships that can extend beyond your time at the JMSB.We also offer a session for parents or guardians of international students. Presentation by academic advisors and health professionals are geared to respond to specific concerns and questions that parents may have. The sessions are followed by a luncheon with other parents, academic staff and advisors. Please register in advance at the following links:Undergraduate students
