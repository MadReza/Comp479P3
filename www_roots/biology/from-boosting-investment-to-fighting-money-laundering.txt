The commission is an independent statutory body responsible for enforcing compliance with anti-money-laundering rules and regulations.In December, Strachan took the helm as chairman of the board of directors at the Bahamas International Securities Exchange, providing guidance to promote further development of capital markets in the Bahamas.“Rates of saving here in the Bahamas tend to be very low and, in a similar fashion, investing is low as well. Most companies don’t use capital markets, they use banks,” he explains. “The exchange plays the role of bringing savers and investors together, so we want to increase investor participation and get more people involved in the capital markets.”Strachan has more than 25 years of experience in international private banking as a banker, portfolio manager, relationship manager and economist. He has worked at Clariden Leu, Nassau Branch, and Credit Suisse Bahamas, notably achieving outstanding results with funds invested in international equity and bond markets.Strachan attributes his enthusiasm for finance and economics to his alma mater.“Concordia was one of the key foundations for my learning. When I was there, I developed my passion for economics and international finance,” he says.Both his degrees are in economics and his graduate specialization was in international finance and econometrics. He has also studied and trained in the United States, England and Switzerland.Strachan has served on a number of public and private boards, financial organizations and advisory committees in the Bahamas.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFrom boosting investment to fighting money launderingDepartment of Economics
