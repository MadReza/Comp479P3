JMSB was also awarded the best overall standing in the Student Initiatives category.The Corporate Knights survey evaluates how effectively MBA programs incorporate sustainability into the business education experience. It ranked Canadian MBA programs annually from 2003 onwards, but has now been expanded to include international institutions.“JMSB is committed to ensuring that today’s business decisions lead to a greener, more sustainable future,” says Steve Harvey, dean of the John Molson School of Business. “These survey results recognize that commitment and confirm that JMSB is increasingly being viewed as a global leader in the advancement of sustainable enterprise.”The business school’s commitment to sustainability goes back some time. In 2008, JMSB was one of the first signatories of the UN Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) that embody sustainable principles in business. Sustainability was integrated into the school’s departments by hiring research faculty with an interest in sustainable enterprise, and by establishing courses that focus on ethical and responsible business.The business school now houses two research centres dedicated to scholarship in the area of sustainability, two responsible business-related internship programs, and a certificate program for investment professionals interested in sustainable investing. A French version of the certificate program will be launched this fall.In June, JMSB co-convened the first-ever PRME Canada Regional Meeting."The Corporate Knights global green MBA rankings acknowledge Concordia’s efforts to promote positive business practices,” says Concordia President Alan Shepard. “JMSB is a vital link to forward-thinking business leaders who create innovative solutions that work.”Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia MBA second-greenest in the worldNews
