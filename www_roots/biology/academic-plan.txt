Based on Concordia’s Strategic Framework, Reaching Up, Reaching Out, the plan outlines how the university will realize its vision to be ranked among Canada’s top five comprehensive universities.The plan — made up of five, top-level objectives and 82 corresponding actions — was designed to benefit every segment of the Concordia population.
