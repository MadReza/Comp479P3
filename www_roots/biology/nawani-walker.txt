Tara Walker and Vinay Nawani tracked the real costs of a blackout by interviewing 170 restaurateurs, gas station owners, retailers, grain millers and others. They’re passing their findings on to Uganda’s government, academics, business community and hydroelectric company as the framework for a discussion on how best to help businesses, and consumers, prosper.Why Concordia is the right place for Walker: “If you have a vision for what you want to do, you’ll find resources and support to make it happen.”Why Concordia is the right place for Nawani: “There are so many opportunities here. The biggest challenge becomes grabbing as many of them as you can.”© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityVinay Nawani and Tara WalkerJoin the ConversationRelated LinksBusiness Administration
