http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/graduate/mba/beyond-the-classroom/speaker-series.htmlThe John Molson Graduate Student Association (JMGSA) Speaker Series is a student-run initiative that organizes speaker events for students. Speaker Series events are open to all JMSB graduate students. The purpose of the Speaker Series is to inspire and motivate students by providing an opportunity to interact with prominent Canadian and international business leaders in a unique and intimate setting. These events expose students to local and international business environments and can help form decisions regarding future career paths and direction.  Students will have the opportunity to realize what it takes to make an organization work and how classroom theory is put into practice by industry leaders. Inspiration, evolution and preparation are the underlining objectives that drive the JMGSA Speaker Series towards providing students with an impactful and rewarding experience.The JMGSA is managed by an engaged and diverse team of four graduate students from the John Molson School of Business.Julia brings her extensive experience in project management, public speaking and events to the JMGSA Speakers Series. Julia is a former performance ski coach and recognizes the impact positive contribution can have on a team.
