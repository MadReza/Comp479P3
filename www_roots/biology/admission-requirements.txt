Entry to this program requires a clearly formulated program of study, research proposal and the identification of a proposed supervisory committee as part of the application. Prospective supervisors and committee members must provide a letter of intent as well. Faculty members are expected to detail the financial support and office or studio space they will provide to prospective graduate students. INDI considers the merit of the student’s proposal and grades as well as the level of support given by the committee. Students whose supervisors do not provide funding or space are less likely to be accepted.If you are a doctoral applicant interested in pursuing a degree in interdisciplinary studies in the areas of Interdisciplinary Studies in Society and Culture, then you should apply to the PhD in Humanities Program.The deadline for applications is January 15 for Fall entry and September 15 for Winter entry.You can apply online. Please note that even when you apply on-line, some documents must be submitted in hard copy (e.g., letters of reference, letters of intent) either by mail or in person to:Mailing Address
