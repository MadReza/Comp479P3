http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/electrical-engineering-meng.htmlThis program of Master in Engineering is designed to provide practicing engineers with an opportunity to strengthen and extend the knowledge they have obtained at the undergraduate level, to develop their design skills, and to enhance their ability to present technical material in written form.This program is a course-based master's degree, Students who wish to have the option of continuing on to a Ph.D. should enroll in the MASc program instead of the MEng program.Requirements for the DegreeDepending on individual department requirements, students may choose to do one or more projects as part of their program. Admission Requirements. Applicants to the MEng Program must hold a bachelor’s degree in engineering or equivalent with high standing. Applicants with a bachelor’s degree in architecture with high engineering content may also be considered for the MEng program. Such students will be required to enrol in an extended program. The Faculty Graduate Studies Committee will determine the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require an applicant to take specified undergraduate courses in order to qualify for acceptance. Qualified applicants requiring prerequisite courses may be required to take such courses in addition to their regular graduate program. Applicants with deficiencies in their undergraduate preparation may be required to take a qualifying program. An ability to write simple programs in a standard computer language will be assumed. Students lacking this skill will be required to register for the appropriate course. This course will be taken in addition to regular degree requirements.Admission to this program also requires the candidate meet English proficiency requirements.Priority will be given to those who apply within the official deadlines listed above. Some programs may continue to accept applications after these deadlines. For more information, please contact the department.Students must complete 45 credits distributed as follows:A minimum of 36 credits consisting of 6000 numbered courses chosen from Topic Areas: E01, E03, E10, E42, E43, E44, E45, E47, E48, F03, and ELEC/COEN courses in E02.These credits should be structured as follows:The remaining nine (9) credits must be obtained by selecting one of the following:

Course descriptionsView course descriptions in the Graduate CalendarGraduate funding is available in various forms.Teaching Assistant (TA) assignments are awarded to qualified graduate students (PhD, MASc, MEng). The basic requirements are technical knowledge and good communication skills as demonstrated by past experience and academic record. ENGR 6971 Project and Report I (4 credits). The purpose of the project report is to provide students in the MEng program with an opportunity to carry out independent project work and to present it in an acceptable form. The project may consist of the following:Before registration for a project course, a student must obtain written consent of a faculty member who will act as advisor for the report. A form for this consent is available in the Office of the Dean of Engineering and Computer Science.A four-credit report is due on the last day of classes of the term (fall, winter, summer) in which it is registered. Students are expected to have a preliminary version of their report approved by their advisor before its final submission. On or before the submission deadline, students must submit three copies of the report to their advisors, who will grade the report. One copy of the report will be returned to the students, one retained by the advisors, and one by the department.The report, including an abstract, must be suitably documented and illustrated, should be at least 5000 words in length, must be typewritten on one side of 21.5 cm by 28 cm white paper of quality, and must be enclosed in binding. Students are referred to Form and Style: Thesis, Report, Term Papers, fourth edition by Campbell and Ballou, published by Houghton Migglin.ENGR 6981 Project and Report II (4 credits)ENGR 6991 Project and Report III (5 credits)With the permission of their Department, students in the MEng Program may register for these project courses if they wish to carry out a more extended project, or if they wish to complete further projects. Each project course requires prior approval by the faculty member who has accepted to supervise the work. Students working on a multi-course project must register for the corresponding project courses in successive terms. For ENGR 6991 and multi-course projects, the report is due on the last day of classes of the last term in which they are registered. In the case of ENGR 6991 and multi-course project, three copies of the report must be submitted to the advisor on or before this deadline, and students are also required to make an oral presentation to the evaluators, and other members of the community. The report will be evaluated by the advisor and at least one other Engineering and Computer Science member of the Faculty.Industrial Experience Option in the Master of EngineeringApplicants to the Master of Engineering may apply to the Industrial Experience option in the industrial milieu through the Institute for Co-operative Education. Students should indicate their choice on the application form. The Institute for Co-operative Education will help them with resumes, cover letters and interview techniques. The suggested schedule is as follows: fall and winter terms will be dedicated to course work followed by one term in industry, culminating with two terms in University for the remaining course work. The industrial experience term will be noted on the student transcript/record.Students apply to the Industrial Experience option as early as possible, preferably when they enter the program. It is preferable to be bilingual in French and English if they wish to work in Quebec. Students who lack good language skills and still want to be part of the program should improve their language skills prior to final acceptance.Admission CriteriaStudents need to be enrolled in the Industrial Experience option at least the semester before going on a work term. They begin applying for jobs the semester prior to the work term. Previous work experience cannot be used toward credit for the ENCS 6931. Students should have good grades (greater than a CGPA of 3.40) for the master’s program, be full-time and have good communication skills. A Canadian work permit is required. The Departmental Co-op Program Director will recommend final acceptance to the Industrial Experience option.ENCS 6931 Industrial Stage and Training (9 credits)
Prerequisite: Completion of at least twenty credits in the program and permission of the Departmental Co-op Program Director.
This is an integral component of the Industrial Experience option that is to be completed under the supervision of an experienced engineer/computer scientist in the facilities of a participating company (a Canadian work permit is required).
Each student receives an assessment from the Departmental Co-op Program Director in consultation with the industry supervisor and the faculty advisor. Grading is on a pass/fail basis based on a proposal, monthly progress reports, a final report and a presentation.Learn more about the Industrial Experience option.Email: Diane@ece.concordia.caTel.: 514-848-2424 ext. 3103Location:
