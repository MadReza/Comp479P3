As an accomplished breakdancer, JoDee Allen knows what’s possible in terms of the competitive, fun element of improvisation. Her goal is to help develop video games where players get points for their creative genius, rather than for how well they replicate a move. To design a video game that can take information back from the player and adjudicate it would be a big step up in complexity for software programmers. But there’s room to do it, says Allen, if you think differently about what the game is about.Why Concordia is the right place for her: “I’ve been able to do something very, very specific and really design the path that I wanted to follow. That flexibility has been extremely exciting.”© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityJoDee AllenJoin the ConversationRelated LinksDance and Game Design
