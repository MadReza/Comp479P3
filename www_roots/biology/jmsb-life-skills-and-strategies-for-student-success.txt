http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/jmsb/2017/02/15/jmsb-life-skills-and-strategies-for-student-success.htmlIn the highly competitive corporate world we live in today, many firms fail, some manage to survive and some prosper. Firms do not plan to fail but sometimes they fail to plan. Successful firms tend to be those that establish clear goals and sound strategies to achieve those goals.

University years too, can be challenging. Students must plan to succeed.

In order to help you be successful, we are offering a session on Skills and Strategies for Student Success. Come and find out how you too can be successful in school by developing and adopting active learning skills and getting rid of those passive ones that you may have acquired in previous years.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
