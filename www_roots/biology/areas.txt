http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/biology/research/areas.htmlOur research fields are grouped into two broad areas of biology: ecology and cell/molecular biology. Basic and applied research is carried out in the department with the support of industry and of the granting agencies of the provincial and federal governments.The Department’s wide range of recent and ongoing research projects is given below in alphabetical order.Evolution of chemical communication in fishes, the role of chemical alarm signals in risk assessment and mediation of predation risk, kin-selection of social behaviour. Self-organizational of social behaviour, insect nutrition and feeding behaviour. Behavioural ecology of aggression, resource defence, animal contest theory and territoriality. Foraging behaviour, parental investment, mating systems and sexual selection.ResearchersChloroplast biogenesis, cell-cycle-dependent gene expression in yeast, intercellular protein trafficking and protein secretion by yeast. Membrane traffic and vesicle recognition in the early secretory pathway. Molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging and development. Regulation of the cytoskeleton during cytokinesis. Biological electron transfer mechanisms; structure-function relationships in heme proteins and multifunctional enzymes.ResearchersEvolution of chemical communication in fishes, the role of chemical alarm signals in risk assessment and mediation of predation risk, kin-selection of social behaviour. Self-organizational of social behaviour, insect nutrition and feeding behaviour. Behavioural ecology of aggression, resource defence, animal contest theory and territoriality. Foraging behaviour, parental investment, mating systems and sexual selection.Cell cycle control in yeast. Metabolic engineering of isoprenoid synthesis, proteomics and genomics of cellulosomal bacteria; protein engineering and protein targeting. Slime mold life cycle and development. Functional genomics: research in genomics and proteomics spans from fundamental investigations through industrial applications. The basic research focuses on well characterized model organisms which are amenable to genetic manipulation while the applied research primarily utilizes micro-organisms with significant impact on industry, human health and the environment.The molecular Biology of plant tolerance to environmental stress and plant development. The study of tolerance to environmental stresses including salt, low temperature and water stress through the characterization of gene regulation and stress response signaling pathways. Signaling and regulation of plant stomatal development.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityResearch areasDepartment of Biology
