The circle aims at bringing pleasure and confidence in children while doing mathematics. The problems during each meeting will be centered around a specific topic. The instructor is bilingual and will accommodate students from both English and French instruction schools. For more information, please feel free to send an email at montrealmathclub@gmail.com.
