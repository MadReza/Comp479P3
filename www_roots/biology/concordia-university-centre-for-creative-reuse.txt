Aspiring to become a zero waste campus, CUCCR provides a major step in the right direction with a mandate of re-visioning clean reusable materials to create opportunities and intersections for innovation through interdisciplinary research and collaboration.Concordia University’s Centre for Creative Reuse (CUCCR) is excited to present a new design for this donated instrument through Montreal’s Public Pianos project. Inspired by acts of communal sharing and artistic reuse, the piano highlights the beauty in sustainable practices of recycling paired with community arts.September 12th - Tabling at the Loyola BBQ/Orientation We will be tabling at the Welcome BBQ/Orientation on Loyola Campus from 11:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. where students can learn more about the Centre and how to be a part of the project.September 13th - Concordia Community Into session/meeting (GM-1000)We invite interested Faculty and staff to learn more about the CUCCR and to discuss the next steps of the project such as: Materials Systems Desigh - How to document the flow of materials in and out of the Centre, Material Survey and Departmental Outreach - How to connect with departments on campus and inquire about potential reusable materials as well as Design and Media - How to disseminate the progress, plans and ideas for the CUCCR to the community.  At its core CUCCR will capture an array of both conventional and unconventional material out of the Concordia’s waste stream and mobilize the selection through creative and pedagogical initiatives spanning all departments.  Additionally to the direct increases of access to valuable material and unique approaches to acts of reuse, a heightened awareness of the Concordia’s waste and consumption will hopefully inspire consideration for sustainable practices. https://www.facebook.com/CUCCR/reuse@concordia.ca© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia University Centre for Creative Reuse (CUCCR)Featured NewsProject GoalsUp Coming EventsConctact UsConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
