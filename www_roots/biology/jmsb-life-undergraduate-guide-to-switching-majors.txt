http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/jmsb/2017/02/10/jmsb-life-undergraduate-guide-to-switching-majors.htmlSome students go to university knowing exactly what they want to do. But most don’t. We know that picking a major can be a difficult decision for some students. How to decide?

If you are still not sure whether the major you had declared on your application is right for you, then this is the workshop for you. Professors from each department will make presentations on the different BCOMM majors as well as give you information on the career prospects in each field.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
