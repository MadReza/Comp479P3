This link helps you to know whether Concordia has the journal mentioned in the reference. A journal title search in CLUES will also show you if the periodical is available at Concordia. Most databases listed are licensed by the Concordia Library and require a Library PIN to be accessed off-campus.Back to topThese are arranged in alphabetical order by issuing body on shelves designated "Standards" in the Webster Library Reference area. Standards are listed in CLUES but some can still be difficult to find. If you are not sure if the library has a copy of a standard you are looking for, speak to a Reference Librarian.

Examples of major standard-making bodies are: ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers); ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials); CSA (Canadian Standards Association); SAE (Society of Automobile Engineers). Most organizations have their own web sites to identify standards. Some codes and standards are posted on the Internet by their issuing bodies.Back to topSee also the Research Guide by Subject for Mechanical and Industrial Engineering on the Libraries' web site.Back to top Back to research guide homeSee also
