Standards are listed in CLUES but some can still be difficult to find. If you are not sure if the library has a copy of a standard you are looking for, speak to a Reference Librarian.Examples of major standard-making bodies are: ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials); ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers); CSA (Canadian Standards Association); ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Most organizations have their own web sites to identify standards. Some codes and standards are posted on the Internet by their issuing bodiesBack to topThere may be Canadian or Quebec statutes (laws) and regulations that would be of interest. These are found in the Webster Government Documents unit and on the Internet. Other government reports may also be useful and may be catalogued as part of the libraries circulating collection or available in Webster Government Documents unit. Consult Reference or Government Documents staff to find out how best to look for government documents on your topic.Back to topSee also the Research Guide by Subject for Mechanical and Industrial Engineering on the Libraries' web site.Back to top Back to research guide homeSee also
