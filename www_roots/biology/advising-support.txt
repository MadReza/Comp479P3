Department Objectives

The Biology Department is dedicated to teaching and research that advance understanding of life from molecules and cells to organisms, populations, and entire ecosystems. The Department’s programs inspire students with an appreciation of the rich diversity of the living world.
Students acquire a comprehensive grounding in modern biology through classroom study as well as extensive hands-on training in research methodology. A variety of specialized laboratories and equipment supports both research and teaching activities.
Programs

The Biology Department offers Honours and Specialization programs in Biology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Ecology, as well as Major and Minor programs in Biology. Students planning a career or graduate studies in the biological sciences normally follow the appropriate honours or specialization program. The major program is designed for students who wish to study biology and either obtain a more general education or pursue an additional program in another discipline. The major program can be combined with a major in another department.
Students registered in the Honours, Specialization, or Major in Biology may select Biology electives in various subject areas in order to obtain a broad overview of the discipline. However, it is possible for students to pursue in-depth studies in specific areas such as animal biology, plant biology, or microbiology and biotechnology.
The minor program can only be taken by students registered in another degree program and provides an opportunity to gain a basic exposure to the main sub-disciplines of Biology or to pursue one such area in some depth.
Students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of academic counselling services available in the Biology Department in order to select the program and courses that best meet their needs. Students may transfer among programs after the first year of study since the core courses in all programs are quite similar.
Students are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements.

The superscript indicates credit value.
Students seeking admission to the honours program may apply either for direct entry on the University application form or, once in the program, to the departmental honours advisor normally following the completion of 30 credits.

The Biology co-operative program is offered to students who are enrolled in the BSc Honours or Specialization in Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; and Ecology. Students interested in applying for the Biology co-op should refer to §24 where a full description of the admission requirements is provided.
Academic content is identical to that of the regular program, but six study terms are interspersed with three work terms.
Students are supervised personally and must meet the requirements specified by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Institute for Co-operative Education in order to continue their studies in the co-op format.
Liaison between the student, the employers and the Institute for Co-operative Education is provided by the Biology co-op committee, which includes the student’s advisors.
Please refer to §24 for the schedule of study and work terms and the full description of admission requirements.
