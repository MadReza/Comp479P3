As a mechanical engineer, you will create, construct and control machines. Whether it’s a vehicle, an aircraft engine or an assembly line, mechanical engineers know how to make things run.
Choose to specialize in Aerospace and Propulsion, Design and Manufacturing or Systems and Mechatronics. Our state-of-the-art labs — such as the Engineering Design and Manufacturing and Flight Control lab — will give you experience with the tools you’ll use in the field. Through labs, lectures and projects, you’ll also:Our program is accredited by Engineers Canada and you'll graduate eligible to become a registered professional engineer.A Bachelor of Engineering degree takes a minimum of four years (120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background. Options:In the third year of study, students may choose one of the following options:Read more about the Mechanical Engineering options.Applicants who do not meet the minimum requirements or with partial prerequisites are encouraged to apply and will be reviewed holistically. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program.Admission is based on applicants' overall CRC, including above-average grades in mathematics and physics, and completion of the following classes as part of their DEC.

Prerequisites for all BEng programs and the BCompSc Computer Systems Option:
 CHEM 101 or 202-NYA; MATH 103 or 201-NYA and 203 or 201-NYB and 105 or 201-NYC; PHYS 101 or 203 NYA and 201 or 203 NYB

Cegep applicants completing a three-year technical DEC in a related field are eligible for admission if they meet the overall CRC requirements. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program. Students may be eligible for exemptions/transfer credits based on course equivalencies.Prerequisites for all BEng programs and the BCompSc Computer Systems Option: Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra, Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, General Chemistry I

Transfer credits may be considered on a course‑by‑course basis.Students will be assessed according to their educational background. Some or all prerequisites will be added to the program at Concordia. IB Standard Level courses (SL) are not eligible for exemptions. Students from Bacc. Français schools with Série ES may be considered for admission to some programs.Prerequisites for all BEng programs and the BCompSc Computer Systems Option: Math and Physics (Chemistry if Physics not offered)Engineering students are able to add a minor in another discipline once they have completed at least 21 credits and if they maintain a GPA of 2.70. Refer to the Undergraduate Calendar for details.Minimum cut-off averages should be used as indicators. The cut-off data may change depending on the applicant pool. As our programs are competitive, applicants who meet the stated minimum requirements are not guaranteed admission to these programs.Make sure you also meet Concordia’s minimum admission requirements.We consider complete applications year round and we give priority to applicants who apply by official deadlines. Late applications will be considered if places are still available for the fall term only.We reserve the right to close admission to a program at any time after the official deadline without prior notice.
