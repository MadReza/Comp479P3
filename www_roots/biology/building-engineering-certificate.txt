Students with high standing in their bachelor program and whose academic records satisfy the requirements for good standing in the Master’s Program in Building Engineering may apply for transfer to the MEng or MASc program.Requirements for completionThe program can be completed in one to three years. Students with high standing in their bachelor program and whose academic records satisfy the requirements for good standing in the Master’s Program in Building Engineering may apply for transfer to the Master’s program.Admission requirementsApplicants to a certificate must hold a bachelor’s degree in engineering or architecture or equivalent with an above-average standing. The Department will recommend on the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require the applicant to do specific remedial course work to meet the program requirements.Priority will be given to those who apply within the official deadlines listed above. Some programs may continue to accept applications after these deadlines. For more information, please contact the department.CoursesBuilding Science. Core courses: BLDG 6611, 6621*, 6751*.
