From expense controversies, to talks of abolition and reform, to a cohort of new independent senators, Canada’s institution of sober second-thought has undergone serious scrutiny.In this one-day workshop, the former Senate Liberal Leader will cover it all.What should we make of all that has transpired of late? Is the Senate doomed? Does it need change? What exactly does this institution do?Register for this workshop and join Senator Cowan as he outlines his perspectives from the frontline.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
