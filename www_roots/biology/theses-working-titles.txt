http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/sgs/individualized/theses-working-titles.htmlThe following list of working titles of Individualized Program (INDI) master’s and doctoral theses is designed to give the reader an overview of the range of topics our students are exploring, as well as the names (and personal websites) of the faculty members who supervise their research.Prospective INDI students will find it useful to search this database for thesis topics which overlap with their own research interests, and in this way discover the names of Concordia faculty members who could potentially agree to serve on their supervisory committee.Michael Montanaro
