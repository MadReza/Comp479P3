It also placed 80th in the world.The survey evaluates full-time programs by asking students why they decided to take an MBA. The ranking is then weighted by what respondents found to be most important.The 2013 “Which MBA?” covers four categories: opening new career opportunities (35 per cent); personal development/educational experience (35 per cent); increasing salary (20 per cent); and the potential to network (10 per cent). The figures that The Economist collates are a mixture of hard data and the subjective marks given by students.“We operate in a tremendously competitive market, so it is very satisfying to see that The Economist continues to recognize JMSB’s excellence,” says Steve Harvey, dean of JMSB. “This recognition, along with the acknowledgment of other survey results, helps to grow our reputation as a world leader in business education.”The top spot in this year’s rankings went to the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. At no. 22, York University’s Schulich School of Business was the highest-ranked Canadian institution. The other Canadian schools were HEC Montréal (no. 84) and the University of Toronto’s Joseph L. Rotman School of Management (no. 96).Just over two weeks ago, Concordia’s MBA was named second-greenest in the world by the Corporate Knights 2013 Global Green MBA rankings, which evaluate how well business schools integrate sustainability.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia MBA ranked second in Canada by The EconomistNews
