http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/mechanical-industrial/research/electrochemical-green-eng/about/people/riad.htmlI develop new photocurable polymers for stereolithography 3D printing. Particularly, I try to address two challenges: the photostability of the material and its mechanical properties. To make photostable material, I use quantum dots as catalysts for the photocuring reaction. To make stronger material, I try to self-assemble graphene oxide using photocuring.2012Â© Concordia UniversityAbout
