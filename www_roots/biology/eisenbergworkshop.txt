Looking to better understand the challenges associated with growing diversity and the struggles faced by liberal democracies when managing the interests of diverse groups? Look no further, this is the workshop for you.In a diverse society such as Canada’s, where the recognition of diversity and its protection are deeply embedded within institutions of the state, debates have long been over the best ways to recognize and guarantee group rights within a strong liberal framework.In her workshop, Dr. Eisenberg, Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria, will explore the many complexities in the relationships between individuals, groups and the state. She will discuss the fine points that distinguish group pluralism from multiculturalism and group accommodation, as well as the dangers associated with the adoption of one understanding versus another in the management and provision of rights to diverse groups in Canada.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
