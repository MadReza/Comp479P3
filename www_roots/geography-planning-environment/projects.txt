Located in Lachine, Montreal, École Martin-Bélanger and RacineCarrée partnered to develop an engaging environmental learning project. Through a number of planned workshops, the students designed an indoor garden. These designs ranged from simple conventional systems to more advanced systems like hydroponics and aquaponics. The students then pitched their ideas to engineers, gardeners and designers during a design challenge day. The experienced professionals, taken aback at the complex systems the primary school students designed, then assisted them in the detailed paper plans of how they wanted their model to be built.Finally, an indoor garden was constructed by university students and is now used by GRAME-ÉCO-quartier Lachine, a community organization involved in urban agriculture. In a continued shared effort to sustain this connection between traditional academic curriculum (science, math and geography) and the environment, École Martin-Bélanger students will continue to work with university students and members of the community in designing a business model, making improvements to their existing model, working on a coldframe (small outdoor greenhouse) and, ultimately, an outdoor greenhouse.Jardin des Saints-Anges (CSMB): 
Located in Lachine, Montreal, Jardin des Saints-Anges partnered with RacineCarrée and the Adoptez une école movement to develop a social entrepreneurial project to sustain the ‘The Green Brigade’. Established by the school and involving students, teachers and parents, members of the Green Brigade work on projects to beautify the school and, in the process, create a sense of value for the environment. 30 primary students now have the opportunity to work on a business model canvas, which is a document designed to help enterprises manage their operations. The input provided by the primary school students during the workshops, will be refined by business students from Concordia University. The co-created business model canvas or business proposal will then be implemented by the school. This project will begin in Winter 2016.
