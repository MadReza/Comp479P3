http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/research/learning-performance/knowledge-transfer/facilities.htmlOver the years, the CSLP has been very fortunate to have been awarded CFI and MDEIE Infrastructure funding. These funds have allowed us to design, develop, and research tools and software that are offered at no charge to the educational community.Many of these facilities are also used by our partners as they facilitate the collection of data, disseminate the results of our research, and provide professional development opportunities.Shared with the Department of Education, this facility stores the CSLP’s various servers that are used to develop and host our software.Shared with the Department of Education, this facility is used extensively for training and dissemination of CSLP tools, with a focus on: recruitment and maintenance of partnerships; gathering of needs assessment data for product and process design, development and implementation; as well as providing training opportunities for graduate students.Used by our instructional designers and developers, this state of the art development facility with digital sound and recording facilities is used for the development of a variety of multimedia learning tools, made available to the educational community without charge.This portable lab facility allows CSLP researchers to explore effective uses of the various tools that have been developed by the centre. Approximately 50 laptops are lent to research schools to facilitate use and data collection on CSLP software.This facility is used to study second language (L2) learners’ acquisition of morpho-syntax, lexis, and phonology under a variety of experimental conditions that test their attention to form, responses to feedback, use of non-verbal signals, while also exploring how individual differences in their cognitive and affective attributes affect the learning process.  

 Each day, in each class, students at all levels interact with their peers and their teachers or professors, in particular using computerized learning environments. Although the educational reform in Quebec focuses on these learning interactions on the basis of cognitive and affective considerations, current research on learning interactions, based on behavioural data, is limited by incomplete information about cognitive processes and the affective states of the participants on which learning depends. NeuroLab is a research infrastructure which allows a psychophysiological perspective to be added to behavioural studies of learning interactions. Overlaid on this behavioural component, psychophysiological research data about learning interactions represent a completely novel approach full of positive benefits for studying favourable and unfavourable conditions for learning.With state of the art equipment for behavioural (audio-video recording, eye tracking, facial expression recognition) and neurophysiological (encephalography, pupillometery, respiration rates, heart rhythm, electrodermal conductance) measurement and analysis, the infrastructure allows the study of two participants (two learners or one teacher and one learner) interacting relatively normally in authentic contexts.The research that the NeuroLab makes possible can improve our understanding of the cognitive and affective mechanisms that underlie interactions in learning. Subsequently, the expected results should influence the design of learning environments created in academic and professional settings, especially in critical areas identified in the Québec Strategy for Research and Innovation such as science and technology education and literacy. Work carried out in the NeuroLab should significantly contribute to improving learning by identifying the parameters for learning (in class or remotely). Thus, learning activities can be better designed in response to new information about learners’ emotional and cognitive processes during these activities. Finally, the NeuroLab will also contribute to the development of computerized learning environments that emulate certain aspects of human interaction and that will become in turn research environments.Please visit the NeuroLab website or contact Julien Mercier, director of NeuroLab, for any questions regarding research partnerships or graduate studies in this laboratory.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFacilitiesCentre for the Study of Learning and Performance
