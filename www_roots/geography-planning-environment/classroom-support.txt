If the problem cannot be resolved, these incidents will be escalated to a higher level support team which will ensure resolution and follow-up with our clients.Check the IT Service Catalog’s documentation for the classroom you’re using to determine the types of available connections. Currently, VGA is the standard connection type, although there are some rooms that now support HDMI. If you have an Apple device such as a Macbook or Ipad, you will need to supply your own adapter.
