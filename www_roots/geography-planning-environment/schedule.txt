http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/exams/schedule.htmlWe create two examination schedules, a tentative and final, for students and faculty to consult. Read this page to learn how and when to find out about your exam schedule and what to do in case of a conflict.Be sure to review all the university regulations concerning examinations in Section 16.3.7 of the undergraduate calendar.Each fall and winter semester we receive information about final exams from the academic departments of each Faculty and School. We use this information to prepare a tentative exam schedule. The tentative schedule gives you an idea of what your exam schedule may be like and helps you set your study priorities.The tentative schedule is just exactly that – tentative. We do make changes before issuing the final examination schedule. You should not make travel or employment arrangements based on your tentative exam schedule.It is your responsibility to be available for the entire examination period! The range of Final Exam Dates is available online a year in advance. We cannot make special arrangements for examinations that may conflict with travel or employment plans.You must understand that it is your responsibility to be available during the entire exam period.We issue the tentative exam schedule as follows:Tentative exam schedule postingExam periodMid-OctoberDecemberMid-FebruaryAprilCheck your personalized tentative schedule via the MyConcordia portal.You can review the tentative exam schedule in a print or digital format:If you notice an exam conflict in your tentative schedule, don’t panic. The conflict may disappear when we issue the final exam schedule. Check your final exam schedule and let us know if you still have a conflict.
The final schedule is the official record of courses that hold exams administered by the Examinations Office. The final schedule provides the date, time and location of your exams and we issue the schedule well in advance to help you organize your time.The examination schedule lists only those examinations scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If one of your courses is not listed in the final exam schedule, check with your instructor.It is your responsibility to write the correct examination at the indicated time and place. We cannot make special arrangements for examinations that may conflict with travel or employment plans.We issue the final exam schedule as follows:Final exam schedule postingExam periodEarly NovemberDecemberEarly MarchAprilCheck your personalized final schedule via the MyConcordia portal.You can review your final exam schedule in a print or digital format: Here’s what to do if you find a conflict in your final exam schedule.Examination Office© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityExam scheduleStudent hub
