http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/sexual-assault/consent.htmlSilence is not consent! The absence of “no” is not consent! Any unwanted, non-consensual, sexual contact is sexual assault. There are a range of behaviors and actions that fall under the definition of sexual assault. Sexual assault is not only unwanted penetration (rape), it is also any unwanted contact such as touching, kissing or grabbing.Consent is an agreement between all participants. It must be mutual, voluntary, informed, sober, and ongoing.One of the most important things you can do is ask for, and ensure you have, your partner’s consent. The word consent means to ‘agree’ or ‘give permission’. In a potential sexual situation it is very important that you ask your partner for consent and receive a positive verbal response before any sexual contact occurs.Take a look at our new consent campaign, Get consent. Ask. Listen. Respect, developed by students for students.  Shared with permission.Produced by Blue Seat Studios
