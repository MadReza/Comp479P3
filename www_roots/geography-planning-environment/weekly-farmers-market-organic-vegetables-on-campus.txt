Hall Building.The successful weekly farmers’ market sprung up on the Sir George Williams Campus last fall.Anthropology undergraduate Alejandra Melian-Morse co-founded it as part of an internship course on social economy, supervised by Satoshi Ikeda, an associate professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. The market started off small, selling local and organic products from mostly university-based projects and groups such as the Concordia Greenhouse and Le Campus Potager.One year later, the initiative has mushroomed to 12 to 15 vendors each week, including local farmers, beekeepers and jam makers.During warmer months, the market was held in the FOFA Gallery courtyard just outside the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV), which meant access to the community outside of the university.But from now until April, the market, a working group of the Concordia Food Coalition, will be found in the Hall mezzanine along the north wall, between the Hive Café and Reggie’s.The space is provided by the student associations, and funding comes from the Sustainability Action Fund and the Concordia Student Union.“Last week was our first in the Hall mezzanine and it worked out really well,” says Melian-Morse. “I think we brought a lot of life to the space and the vendors were very happy with the business they got.” Until April 2016, check out the fabulous array of vegetables and other tasty local goods at the farmers’ market every Wednesday afternoon, from noon to 6 p.m. in the mezzanine of the Hall Building.Faculty and staff: The delivery of winter veggie baskets is now available via Les Bio Locaux. Find out more at an information session on Tuesday, November 3, from 12:15 to 1 p.m.  in Room GM-1060.01 in the Guy-De Maisonneuve Building. Or sign up for deliveries that begin on November 17.
