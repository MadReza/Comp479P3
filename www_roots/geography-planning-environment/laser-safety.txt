The LASER Safety program's primary objective is to ensure that no laser radiation in excess of the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) reaches the human eye or skin. This program is also intended to ensure adequate protection against laser-related non-beam hazards.The LASER Safety Program covers all class 3B and class 4 lasers. Every laser installation of class 3B or 4 must have a laser safety plan in place. The process of developing this plan begins with registering the laser with the Gurnam Manku, Laser Safety Officer (LSO), Environmental Health and Safety at extention 4356. VPS-51-Laser Safety PolicyEnvironmental, Health & Safety:
