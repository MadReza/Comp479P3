http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/quartier-concordia/exhibition-series.htmlOne goal of the Quartier Concordia urban planning project is to present public exhibitions that would educate passersby about this neighbourhood's unique characteristics and how Concordia University can have a positive impact on its growth and development.Located on the windows of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex running along Guy Street, these installations are viewed by thousands of pedestrians – day and night – who live, work, study and shop in the downtown core.View our current exhibition, Public space and gathering places: Then and now.For any questions about Quartier Concordia, contact our Media Relations Department.Fiona Downey
