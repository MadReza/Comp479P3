http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/oce.htmlAs a bridging initiative, the Office of Community Engagement supports, connects and promotes new and existing community-university partnerships.  Our goal is to assist students, staff, faculty, and community members in creating both academic and non-academic partnerships, which are innovative and beneficial to all involved.In all spheres – artistic, political, commercial and scientific – Concordians partner with community members to address social issues and shape our changing world. Here's how Concordia connects with its myriad communities:  Concordia is signatory to the Talloires Declaration on the Civic Roles of Social Responsibilities of Higher Education, which adopts the following definition of community engagement:Community Engagement is the respectful and genuine collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of democratic partnership and reciprocity.Concordia is also a member of Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH). The following are CCPH Principles of Partnership:514-848-2424 ext. 4803communityengagement
