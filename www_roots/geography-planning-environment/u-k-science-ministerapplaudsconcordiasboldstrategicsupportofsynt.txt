There's clearly a significant investment here, and I think the university's making a very bold, strategic decision that synthetic biology is something they want to back.”The CASB — Canada’s first dedicated research centre — is leading the way. Its open-concept, state-of-the-art labs on the Loyola Campus are designed to foster interaction biologists, engineers, computer scientists and social scientists. Together, they develop tools and technologies with practical applications in environmental and health management.Vincent Martin, CASB co-director and Canada Research Chair in Microbiology Genomics and Engineering, hopes the country will involve itself in international synthetic biology efforts. “We need to get out there and play with the big boys.”Martin is the lead on CASB's largest project, PhytoMetaSyn: a five-year, $13-million initiative to produce valuable metabolites by modifying the pathways in baker's yeast with genes from other plants.Concordia is participating in iGEM, the international genetically engineered machine competition.
