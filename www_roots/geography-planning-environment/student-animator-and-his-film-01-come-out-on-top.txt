http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2013/06/04/student-animator-and-his-film-01-come-out-on-top.htmlHamish Lambert didn’t come to Concordia’s Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema to gain technical training as an animator, but rather, to become a filmmaker.

“There wasn’t enough creative input in other programs,” says the Halifax native. “Concordia professors strive to create filmmakers who engage in original and challenging ways. They teach you to think about what you’re doing, not just doing it.”

One of his favourite teachers was lecturer Luigi Allemano, whom Lambert says is quite effective at explaining material that needs to be explained. “He’s very engaging and makes things make sense, gets things running smoothly.”
 During his time at Concordia, Lambert says he became aware of ideas that he hadn’t thought of before — like the links between architecture and animation, and how animators interact and move through a filmmaking space. He also says he’s learned to absorb what he sees around him and rely on his sense of timing, motion and storytelling.

“At Concordia, we learn to trust the process. You don’t need a great idea at the get-go and it’s okay to hate your ideas sometimes. Interesting outcomes can happen as a result.”

An example of where Lambert trusted the process is with his animated short 01, created for his Animation II class assignment. To complete the task of using looping sounds in his film, Lambert explored the inner workings of an old stereo receiver he found on the street. 01, which can be seen on YouTube, was screened at national film festivals such as the Sommets du cinéma d'animation, Young Cuts and the Atlantic Film Festival.

After graduation, Lambert hopes to work in the film industry for a few years and then pursue a master’s program. He isn’t interested in big studio projects, such as such as television animation. He says he enjoys interacting with other filmmakers and would like to explore the more experimental and aesthetic side of filmmaking.

Lambert’s proud to have been part of the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema’s animation program. Lambert cites several recent accolades received by fellow students, such as Alisi Telengut’s Honourable Mention at the Ottawa International Animation Festival, and adds that it’s “been a good year for Concordia animators.”

Needless to say, it’s been a pretty good one for Lambert, too.
