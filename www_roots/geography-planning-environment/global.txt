http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/aerospace/students/global.htmlAs of 2005, CIADI started international collaboration with a multitude of European companies. Having obtained successful feedback from both industries and students a new aspect called CIADI Global was created. The selected students going abroad had the opportunity to work in a different country and experience many different cultures. Each student participating in CIADI Global did a 500 hour internship during the summer. To this date 77 students also known as "CIADI Technical Ambassadors" have graced the different continents including countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico, Singapore and USA (NASA).© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCIADI globalConcordia Institute of Aerospace Design & Innovation (CIADI)
