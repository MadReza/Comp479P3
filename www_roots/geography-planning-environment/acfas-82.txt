http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/releases/2014/04/11/acfas-82.htmlMontreal, April 14, 2014 – In a few weeks, close to 5,000 researchers will gather in Montreal for the 82nd congress of the Association francophone pour le savoir – Acfas. Sponsored by UNESCO for the second year in a row, Michael Sabia, President and CEO of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec will serve as honorary president of the congress.From May 12 to 16, the researchers, including more than 500 international participants from some 40 countries, will present their latest findings at Concordia University’s downtown campus. Hosting this conference is a first for the university. Activities for the general public will also be taking place outside the Concordia’s walls.Under the theme La recherche : zones de convergence et de créativité, this new edition of the congress will showcase researchers’ ability to mobilize toward increasingly innovative and creative research. “Over the years, the Acfas congress has developed into a wide-ranging conversation between Francophone and Francophile researchers from all disciplines. It’s in this spirit of convergence that new ideas emerge” says Louise Dandurand, President of Acfas.This year, the core program of the congress is made up of close to 3,000 presentations divided into 173 scientific colloquia. All sectors are represented: health sciences, natural sciences, mathematics and engineering, language and literature, arts and humanities, social sciences, and education. There will also be two sets of activities, offered free-of-charge and opened to the public, to encourage a dialogue between researchers and citizens. The first set consists of 900 free presentations, categorized by research area. The second is a series of public events designed to satisfy the curiosity of science enthusiasts. These include walking tours with urban design scholars, lectures, gaming workshops, roundtables, exhibits, the national final for the Ma thèse en 180 secondes competition.Concordia University: creative, urban, bold and engaged
 Recognized for its diversity and community engagement, Concordia offers a variety of events that speak to the university’s creativity, enthusiasm and dynamism, as it celebrates its 40th anniversary. According to Concordia University President, Alan Shepard, “the congress highlights Concordia’s contribution to francophone research that meets the expectations of a constantly-evolving society.” Some key colloquia

Here are a few sessions that are sure to gather a large audience. More suggestions will be presented in Acfas’s upcoming press releases.Free presentations: A new take on science!
