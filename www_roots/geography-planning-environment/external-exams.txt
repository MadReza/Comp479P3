http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/exams/external-exams.htmlAn external exam is an examination that is written at a location outside the instution where you are a student.In certain cases, students may write their Concordia exams at another location. Concordia can also proctor exams in Montreal for students from other accredited institutions.
We expect all students to be available to write final exams and should avoid making travel plans until after the final examination schedule is available. However, you may request to write your exam at an external institution if you are faced with unforeseeable events beyond your control that make it impossible for you to be in Montreal for your exam.If your course is offered by eConcordia, contact them directlyNote: If you are writing an eConcordia exam, you MUST apply for your external exam through the eConcordia website.
