Whenever Concordia welcomes international visitors, it’s a great occasion for us to demonstrate both our talents and our warmth. We have just such an opportunity this May, when we host the 82nd Acfas Congress.The largest multidisciplinary research gathering in the Francophonie places Concordia in the academic spotlight. It also demonstrates Concordia’s deep roots in Montreal and Quebec.We will need to represent our university and city well. I invite our entire community — students, staff, faculty and alumni — to sign up when a call for volunteers goes out later this term.I also hope you will participate in the conference’s many activities. Among the stimulating talks given by international experts, 19 Concordia academics will lead colloquia on topics ranging from preventative health to social economics. Some 50 of our graduate students will present their emerging research.There will also be public events held on campus and at major Montreal institutions. Your weekly NOW eNewsletter will highlight volunteer opportunities and public events throughout the term.I encourage you to participate. Let’s show the world what a next-generation university looks like.Alan Shepard
