http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/campus-life/safety/training.htmlEnvironmental Health & Safety (EHS) provides safety training free to anyone with a valid Concordia ID. Participants are required to register (Refer to Training Calendar below).When you register, a confirmation message will appear on your screen indicating your registration was submitted. You will receive a confirmation via email. Please note: If less than 5 participants are registered for any given training session, EHS reserves the right to cancel the session. Anyone registered will be notify directly. Every attempt will be made to ensure that participants are notified at least seven calendar days prior to the training session that is cancelled.EHS may acknowledge your training or certification obtained from other institutions. For more information, please contact us by email at ehs@concordia.caIf you unable to attend the training session please email EHS at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled date at ehs@concordia.ca.Please Note: Cancellations made by telephone will not be accepted. Students may now add EHS provided safety trainings to their Co-Curricular Record.The Co-Curricular Record (CCR) is an official Concordia University document that highlights your involvement in student life at Concordia. Having a CCR can provide several benefits, such as help in obtaining grants or bursaries, getting into graduate school or adding skills to your resume. Visit the Concordia University Co-Curricular Record website for more details.
The following guide (pdf document) outlines the process of adding your EHS provided safety training to your CCR. Please note you will also need to send a copy of the EHS training certificate to cocurricular@concordia.ca as proof of successful completion.On February 11, 2015, the Government of Canada released the new Hazardous Products Regulations (HPR), modifying WHMIS to incorporate the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) for workplace chemicals. This modified WHMIS is referred to as "WHMIS 2015". A transition period permits suppliers, importers and distributors of hazardous chemicals, as well as employers with such chemicals in their workplaces, to comply with either the WHMIS program first implemented in 1988 (WHMIS 1988) or the newly revised WHMIS program, incorporating the GHS (WHMIS 2015). The transition period began on February 11, 2015 and will end on December 1, 2018.Since both WHMIS programs (WHMIS 1988 and 2015) are valid during the transition period (Feb 2015 to Dec 2018),workers and students are required to obtain training for both WHMIS versions from their employer. EHS will gradually offer WHMIS 2015 training sessions to Faculty, students and staff throughout the next few years, starting in September 2015, to ensure that everyone get trained by December 2018.However, the EHS requirements for the previous WHMIS 1988 program are still in place, meaning that any staff, faculty or students working with chemicals must have a valid WHMIS for Laboratory Personnel training. A valid WHMIS for Laboratory Personnel training (taken less than 3 year ago) is also the prerequisite for anyone who wishes to attend a WHMIS 2015 training session.The Safety Training List provides you with a description of all training sessions offered by EHS.  The following links will redirect you to the available EHS training sessions:To attend a training session you must have a Concordia netname and password to login. If you are having trouble logging in send an email including your Concordia netname to ccw-support@concordia.ca.Following the training session you will have a test to complete.
