The work included replacing 1960s single-pane windows with energy-efficient curtain walls, structural maintenance and repair, and replacing the facade to harmonize with the John Molson Building and the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGuy-De Maisonneuve BuildingCampus maps
