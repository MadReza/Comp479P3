http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/events/conferences/acfas-en/congress-languagepolicyprovisions.htmlOn the occasion of the annual congress, Acfas will ensure that the authors of scientific communications respect the language policy while at the same time facilitating involvement by researchers of the host institution. Presentations are to be made in French, whether they are part of a colloquium or a general session (both oral and poster presentations.) Exceptionally, Acfas will allow some communications to take place in a language other than French for participants involved in a colloquium. These presentations must, however, be supported by a printed PowerPoint presentation in French distributed to those present or arrangements must be made to have an interpreter in the room (all translation and interpreter charge will be borne by the person responsible for the colloquium or by the principal colloquium presenter.) Those responsible for the colloquium must make arrangements with Acfas personnel beforehand. Please consult Acfas’s general policy governing the use of French© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCongress Language Policy ProvisionsEvents
