Origin-destination data on 60,000 residents living in metropolitan areas of varying size, density and population enables us to distinguish the respective roles played by local and regional variations in land use. This is carried out using ordinary least squares and simultaneous equation model regression analysis, with the area of the activity space as dependent variable. The relationship between activity space geometry and mode choice is also explored to better understand which geometries are most conducive to environmentally benign forms of travel (active and transit modes) and what development conditions enable such patterns to emerge. Finally, as tour complexity, trip dispersal and mode choice are intimately related, we use the Microcensus to explore what access modes and which types of environments lead to better chaining of environmentally benign modes in complex tours.Download the poster.  © Concordia UniversityConcordia University
