What influences our behaviour — nature (genetics) or nurture (environment)? Research in neuroscience has shown that humans develop through the interaction of both genetic and environmental influences. In this lecture, noted scientist and triple Concordia graduate Michael Meaney, BA 75, an MA 77 and PhD 81, will summarize recent studies showing how environment can modify the DNA and structure and activity of the genome; that is, how childhood experiences affect genes.

This Homecoming 2013 talk will be the keynote public address of the Center for Studies in Behavioral Neurobiology (CSBN) 30th anniversary celebration and scientific workshop. Meaney is associate director of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute Research Centre and James McGill Professor in the Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University.
