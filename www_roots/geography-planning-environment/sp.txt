http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/maps/buildings/sp.htmlThe Richard J. Renaud Science Complex has changed the face of Concordia's west-end campus. This state-of-the-art teaching and research facility is a lynchpin of the Loyola Campus revitalization. The $85 million purpose-built complex includes teaching facilities, offices, and laboratories for various science departments. The avant-garde design promotes interdisciplinarity and innovation in one of the top university sciences facilities in Canada. The award-winning building also features energy-efficient sustainable architecture. The Complex includes the former Bryan Building (built in 1968), which has been completely renovated and fully integrated into the new structure.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityRichard J.
