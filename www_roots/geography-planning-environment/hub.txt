As interest in sustainability continues to grow and more initiatives develop, it is important for the key stakeholders in sustainability to maintain strong communication ties. This enables stakeholders to be informed on the sustainability initiatives of various groups or departments around campus in order to maximize collaboration and resource sharing.Concordia Graduate Student AssociationConcordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable SystemsConcordia Student UnionConcordia Volunteer Abroad ProgramDavid O’Brien Centre for Sustainable EnterpriseDean of StudentsEnvironmental Health and SafetyThe John Molson Sustainable Business GroupLoyola College for Diversity and SustainabilityOffice of Community EngagementSustainable ConcordiaSustainability Action FundThe Concordia Sustainability hub workgroup is an open group at Concordia that is always looking for new interested members.If your department/group/association would like to join the hub workgroup, please send an email to sustainability@concordia.ca.Environmental, Health & Safety:
