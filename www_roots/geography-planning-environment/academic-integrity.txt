http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/students/academic-integrity.htmlAcademic integrity means that every student must be honest and accurate in their work. This means that there are rules and regulations to follow when presenting your work as your own.(Article 1, Academic Code of Conduct)Concordia University has several resources available to help students better understand and uphold academic integrity: Dr. Mebs Kanji (Political Science) is responsible for interviewing undergraduate students under the Academic Code of Conduct, making the decisions pertaining to these interviews and attending the relevant Academic Hearing Panel cases.He liaises with the Associate Dean, Student Academic Services on Code issues.Reach the administrator at: code.administrator@artsci.concordia.ca or at:  Mebs.Kanji@concordia.ca© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityWhat is academic integrity?Faculty of Arts and Science
