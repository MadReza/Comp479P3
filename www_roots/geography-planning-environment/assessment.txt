http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/campus-life/sustainability/assessment.htmlIn order to understand the scope of sustainability at Concordia and to better implement future sustainable strategies, a sustainability assessment is imperative. In light of this, the first sustainability assessment at Concordia was conducted in 2003 through the creation by Sustainable Concordia of the Concordia Campus Sustainability Assessment (CCSA). Recent versions of the CCSA have benefited from the use at Concordia of a self-reporting sustainability framework called STARS.The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System™ (STARS) developed by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) is a transparent, self-reporting framework to evaluate the sustainability level of different aspects at universities.As described by AASHE, STARS is designed to:For more information, see the AASHE STARS' website
The CCSA reports list recommendations for Concordia towards the improvement of the different aspects of sustainability in its community (operations, education, research, well-being, etc.).The recommendations of the latest CCSA report are being elaborated through discussions with different experts at Concordia on topics related to sustainability (energy, public participation, diversity, governance, etc.). These recommendations can be summarized under four overarching themes:Theme 1 – Create Awareness
 In order for sustainability initiatives to reach their full potential, the different facets and linkages of sustainability need to be better understood at Concordia.Theme 2 – Measure and Report
 Evaluating the success of sustainability initiatives can only be done through regularly measuring and reporting on the specifics of these initiatives.Theme 3 – Enhance or create policies, plans, and guidelines
 Long-term commitments to sustainability involve ensuring the inclusion of sustainability in the governance structure of the university.Theme 4 – Specific Action Items
 Sustainable development prepares for the future through better planning but also through direct actions taken to improve the day-to-day well-being of Concordia’s community members.The purpose of all of the CCSA reports is to showcase the current sustainability situation of the University and propose recommendations to further sustainability at Concordia. Each version of the report builds in part on the previous one while also including new elements representing the evolving reality of sustainability at Concordia University.2003 CCSA report
