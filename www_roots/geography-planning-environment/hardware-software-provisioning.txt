The service includes analysis of user needs, providing information about the current options, purchasing assistance, and installation.Contact the Service Desk or your department designated IT technician or support team.  These knowledgeable technicians will be able to provide counsel on equipment, software, and migration. 
If your specific needs are not met by the standard computer selection and options, you can request a waiver. In those cases, you can contact the Service Desk or your departmental designated IT technician or support team, to discuss other options within the standard family of products or other manufacturers - Dell has very interesting discounts on a variety of products. To purchase a non-standard computer, you will need to fill out the Waiver Request Form detailing the system you wish to purchase and why the standardized systems do not meet your technical requirements. The waiver needs to be submitted to Purchasing Services for approval of the Chief Information Office or delegate.There are several reasons. Costs will be significantly reduced by making bulk purchases of fewer models from one contracted manufacturer. Having fewer models creates a consistency among systems deployed throughout the university, improving compatibility and technical hardware and software support. This also means an easier deployment and updating of software by having pre-installed site-licensed software on each computer.Non-standard computer must be inventoried, asset tagged and protected by installing university anti-virus software just like a standard computer. It will be inventoried and asset tagged, after the purchasing stage, by your local department IT-representative. If you’ve received a non-standard computer that is missing the asset tag, please contact your department designated IT technician or support team  or the IITS Service Desk at help@concordia.ca or extension 7613.Because it makes it clear that the computer belongs to Concordia – no need to provide proof of purchase or receipt.Non-standard computers are supported on a best effort basis either by Instructional and Information Technology Services (IITS) or your designated departmental IT technician or support team. All computers are the property of Concordia University regardless of the source of funds or whether purchased from the standard list or not. Therefore, the computer must be properly inventoried and asset tagged according to the policy and protected by installing university anti-virus software.  Consult the Computer Support section, contact your department IT-representative, or contact the IITS Service Desk at help@concordia.ca or extension 7613.  Sophos Anti-Virus for work-use and home-use is also available to download via the MyConcordia Portal, in Software and Applications.Contact your department IT-representative, the IITS Service Desk at help@concordia.ca or extension 7613Office 2010 has been deployed to many of the computers on campus. To upgrade to Office 2013, contact the Service Desk.The Apple Store for Education is not the same as the Apple Store for Education Institution, which is accessible under the Retail Services link in the MyConcordia portal. Any purchase made on the Apple Store for Education is considered a personal purchase and is not considered to be the property of Concordia University.Concordia University is prohibited from installing campus license agreement software (Microsoft Office, etc.) on a computer purchased from the Apple Store for Education.  Users purchasing a computer for work use and or with University funds should go through the Apple Store for Education Institution in the MyConcordia portal.For the educational sector, Apple only accepts the return of unopened products resulting from an Apple shipping or order processing error.  All other sales are final.  The only return exception is if there is a problem with the Apple computer (hardware) upon arrival.  For more information, review Apple's educational sector retun policy.
