You can also help us implement other waste reduction initiatives in your office.Sign-up here!Concordia is targeting food-generating locations for compost bins. After office kitchenettes, Concordia will target event spaces and atriums of major buildings for compost collection. If there are any locations you believe generate enough organics to warrant compost collection, please contact sustainability@concordia.ca.
Try posting your items on shoptalk, craigslist, or kijiji to see if anyone can use it!
Take a look at our compost info page to find out what is compostable what is not. Or have a look at our waste sorting posters (available below) to find out what goes in compost, recycling, or trash.
We're counting on you to keep your mini bin clean and odor-free. Use your kitchenette sink to wash your mini bin. And make sure to empty your bin before going on vacation!
While at your desk, place any trash, organics, or plastic/glass/metal waste to be disposed of in your mini bin. When you make your next trip to the kitchenette, you can empty your mini bin sorting items into the right bins.
No! Only desk-side trashes will be removed. Trash bins in kitchenettes and those that are part of other waste stations will remain.
Compost bins will be emptied from kitchenettes more often than your trash, ensuring there is no risk of odors or fruit flies.
The rollout schedule is currently being reworked.
