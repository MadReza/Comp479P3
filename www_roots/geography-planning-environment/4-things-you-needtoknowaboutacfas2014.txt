From May 12 to 16, 2014, Concordia is hosting the largest multidisciplinary gathering of knowledge and research in the French-speaking world.The application deadline for general session papers by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows is fast approaching: those wishing to submit a proposal have until November 25.Keen but not yet convinced? Here are four key points about the congress, from two experts —Concordia’s Yves Gélinas and Sophie Marcotte, co-presidents of the Acfas Scientific Committee.Yves Gélinas: The Acfas Congress offers a supportive and positive environment that graduate students can use as a launching pad for promoting their emerging research. It’s the ideal way for young researchers to get their feet wet if they’re presenting their work for the first time.Events like Acfas are the best way to make important connections with future collaborators.Sophie Marcotte: The Acfas Congress is incredibly inclusive by nature. From biology to engineering to the humanities and fine arts, all disciplines are represented.

This is important because funding bodies are increasingly looking to finance research that involves numerous disciplines. Acfas is an excellent place to make headway with academics from a variety of areas of study.YG: Concordia’s School of Graduate Studies will reimburse the application fee for students whose general session papers are accepted at Acfas.
SM: Because this is a French conference, there are certain criteria when it comes to language. Applications must be in French, as well as presentations of general session papers.If you’re not a native speaker, then we recommend you have your material reviewed by a francophone colleague or supervisor.
