Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO) is a digitized collection of every single title printed in Great Britain in English and other languages during the 1700s, as well as important works from the Americas.
The more than 186,000 fully searchable titles include works about history, geography, social sciences, fine arts, medicine, science and technology, literature and language, religion and philosophy, law, as well as other reference materials.

The new acquisitions is one of the key actions designed to support Concordia's current Academic Plan. The plan's three main priorities are innovative and dynamic undergraduate offerings, graduate student recruitment, and investments in the libraries.
