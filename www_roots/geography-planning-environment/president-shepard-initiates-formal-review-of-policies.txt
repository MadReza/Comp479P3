http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2014/12/03/president-shepard-initiates-formal-review-of-policies.htmlVersion françaiseIn recent days, there has been a great deal of media attention focused on sexual assault on campuses across Canada. The safety and well-being of our students is a top priority at Concordia. In order to ensure we are doing everything we can to prevent and respond to sexual assault, I have asked Deputy Provost Lisa Ostiguy to lead a formal review of Concordia’s relevant policies and protocols. Joining Deputy Provost Ostiguy in this initiative will be the dean of Students, Andrew Woodall, as well as faculty, staff and student representatives. By initiating this formal review, I hope to continue Concordia’s tradition as a leader in promoting the safety and well-being of our community.Concordia was the first university in Canada to create the position of sexual harassment advisor in 1987 and one of the first to adopt a policy on sexual harassment in the early 1990s. We were also among the first Canadian universities to create an Ombuds Office in the 1970s.Last year, Concordia launched the Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC) to inform the campus community about consent, prevention and survivor support.Our formal review of policies and protocols will begin this semester and continue in the Winter semester.
