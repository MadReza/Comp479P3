Rather, a significant population of Concordia students, especially those in the Sciences, will spend the majority of their entire degree at this particularly unassuming campus in the suburbs. But many of them will not know everything this area has to offer. Join Zarin, a student mentor with the Student Success Centre for a walking tour of Loyola. On this promenade, we will explore underutilized study spaces, food hotspots and discuss other tips to get the most out of the campus and surrounding area.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
