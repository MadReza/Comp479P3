http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/events/conferences/acfas-en/sustainability.htmlSustainability at Concordia has been and continues to be built upon close collaboration between students, staff and faculty. As sustainability is both a complex and complicated issue for an institution to address, we believe the best way to integrate sustainability at Concordia is to think together and work together. Every member of Concordia’s community will benefit from higher sustainability, from a cleaner and more enjoyable learning environment to heightened skills and expertise for tackling the world’s current and future challenges.In line with Concordia’s commitment towards sustainability and considering the large scale of the Acfas Annual Congress, numerous eco-responsible efforts have been implemented by the sustainability professionals of Concordia to ensure that this week-long event is as sustainable as possible.More information about sustainability at ConcordiaMore information about the eco-responsible efforts at the Acfas Annual Congress (in French)© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia University’s
