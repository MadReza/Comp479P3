http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/events/conferences/acfas-en/sustainability.htmlSustainability at Concordia has been and continues to be built upon close collaboration between students, staff and faculty. As sustainability is both a complex and complicated issue for an institution to address, we believe the best way to integrate sustainability at Concordia is to think together and work together. Every member of Concordia’s community will benefit from higher sustainability, from a cleaner and more enjoyable learning environment to heightened skills and expertise for tackling the world’s current and future challenges.In line with Concordia’s commitment towards sustainability and considering the large scale of the Acfas Annual Congress, numerous eco-responsible efforts have been implemented by the sustainability professionals of Concordia to ensure that this week-long event is as sustainable as possible.More information about sustainability at ConcordiaMore information about the eco-responsible efforts at the Acfas Annual Congress (in French)© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordia University’s

As a company determined to make a difference in the wellness of people and planet, it was encouraging to team up with the SIP program on their similar mission and even more encouraging to see so many students embrace sustainability and it’s need to be incorporated in every part of our lives. The Sustainable Internship Program team has created an ideal situation for both student and employer, setting guidelines that fulfill both party’s needs. Students with eCause had the opportunity to work in a variety of projects within the company, ranging from website upgrades to marketing and social media, brand development, accounting and sales. We are grateful for the existence of programs such as SIP, not only for the quality and calibre for the students we employed but for our opportunity to help provide experiences to students who have not yet had the chance to see their skills and knowledge put into action".
