I want to know what people are up to,” says Nisi Sinzinkayo, a Moncton, N.B., transplant. For her, Concordia’s Department of Psychology was a natural fit. As Sinzinkayo says: “I see this as a way to understand people even more.”Before taking the plunge and moving to Montreal for her undergraduate studies, Sinzinkayo had developed a strong opinion of both Concordia and Montreal.“I visited the city and have friends who attended Concordia,” says Sinzinkayo. “I like how open-minded people are here. People don’t judge you.”One hurdle for Sinzinkayo is the costs that come with studying.“Coming out of province, tuition is automatically more expensive,” says Sinzinkayo. Add to that, she notes that there are living expenses such as rent and public transit.Sinzinkayo received the Leonard and Bina Ellen Entrance Bursary her first year of study in 2014.“That was a great email to receive,” says Sinzinkayo, who entered the university as a teenager directly from high school. “I have siblings, so I think of all the things my parents help pay for. The bursary was welcome news for all of us,” she says.Sinzinkayo already has long-term career ambitions. “If I could continue going with psychology, that would be great,” says Sinzinkayo. “I would like to complete a PhD.”“Psychology is a good foundational education. As a ‘plan B’ I would want to go into marketing.”Sinzinkayo expects to finish her bachelor’s degree by 2018.
