http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/maps/buildings/cj.htmlThe completely renovated and expanded Communication Studies and Journalism Building opened in September 2005. This building began life in 1962 as the Drummond Science Complex. It now houses state-of-the-art specialized facilities for Communications and Journalism, open lounge space, the bookstore for the Loyola Campus, and a small café. The new installation replaces outmoded facilities for these departments that were in the Bryan Building (built in 1968) until they were displaced at the time of the building of the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex in 2003.The building is designed to integrate cutting-edge technology into the teaching and research spaces. It includes a fully digitized radio and television broadcast operation, network access, high-tech classrooms, new media and computer labs, and studios with a full array of high-end audiovisual equipment, including production, video, and editing suites. This major upgrade was done using sustainable design.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCommunication Studies and Journalism BuildingCampus maps
