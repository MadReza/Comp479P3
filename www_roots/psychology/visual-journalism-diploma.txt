With the emergence of digital media, the responsibility to report, shoot video and take pictures often now fall on the shoulders of one individual. We need critical and aesthetically oriented thinkers to accurately recount impactful visual stories through the use of photography and video.The Graduate Diploma in Visual Journalism provides an environment for you to interact with the strong visual culture that has been produced in the press over the last decade. Offered over an 11-month period that begins in June and finishes the following April, our program focuses on digital and visual journalism production, giving you the necessary skills and training to tell factual narratives through images and video.Under the guidance of acclaimed faculty members, recipients of prestigious honours like the Pulitzer Prize and the Society of News Design Award of Excellence, you will explore various topics related to visual journalism, including documentary and studio photography, photojournalism, and videography. Seminars and courses also supply you with a foundation grounded in the theoretical and analytical dimensions of journalism.With opportunities to grow professionally through internships and network with working journalists, our alumni have terrific success securing jobs in visual journalism or communication.Requirements for the DiplomaCourses. All students are required to complete 33 credits in the following sequence:Summer Term (9 credits)
