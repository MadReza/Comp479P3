Did you know that every month 850,000 Canadians turn to food banks for help? If that statistic is not staggering enough, one third of those recipients are children and youth. As we gear up for the holiday season, Concordia’s Human Resources (HR) Department, along with their partners from Advancement and Alumni Relations, Continuing Education and the Library Administration team, are trying to make a difference in the lives of Montrealers.Starting Monday, October 24, these departments are running an eight-week food drive for Sun Youth, who expect to provide holiday baskets to more than 12,000 individuals in the city this year. Please bring any non-perishable items to the HR Department, located in suite FB-1130 of the Faubourg (FB) Building between Monday, October 24 and Friday, December 16. Together, we can make a big difference in fighting hunger in our community.As part of this year’s drive, HR will be holding a bake sale in the atrium of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV Building) on Monday, November 7, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Come support a great cause and enjoy a sweet treat!  
For more information about the upcoming holiday food drive at Concordia, please contact Madelena Vidal, Maureen McCormick or Michelle Taylor from the Human Resources Department.
