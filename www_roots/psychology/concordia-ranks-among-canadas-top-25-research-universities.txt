Concordia experienced a 2.3 per cent increase to $58,800 per faculty member.This is just the latest academic ranking to recognize Concordia’s positive growth this year. Late last month, the Times Higher Education released its 2015 World University Rankings, showing Concordia in the top 500 for the first time. The higher standing was credited in part to the university’s research performance.The university also improved its position in the QS World University Rankings for the fourth consecutive year, rising to the 411–420 range from last year’s position in the 461–470 range.Earlier this week, the Economist released its rankings of the world’s best MBA programs. Concordia broke the top 100, and earned fourth place among Canadian business schools.
