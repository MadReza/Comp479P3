http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2014/06/18/summer-book-list17greatreads.htmlIt’s official: summer is here. What better way to spend a long, hot afternoon than picking a book and hunkering down by the lake, on the porch or in the shade of a friendly willow tree?We asked 15 Concordia students, staff and faculty to tell us their favourites. From a three-part history of Byzantium to Nathan Englander’s provocative short stories to a practical guide to Becoming a Supple Leopard, there's something for everyone on this list.Happy reading!

By Nathan EnglanderA good friend and colleague left a copy of Nathan Englander's short story collection at my cottage, and I wasn't able to put it down. I’m just sorry I read it all before I got my first sunburn!Punchy, funny stories about people between the life of the mind and a world that doesn't often co-operate, many of which take place in a hot, sunny place.Bradley Tucker

By John Julius NorwichByzantium: The Decline and Fall
 Knopf, 1995
By John Julius NorwichIn a case of truth being stranger than fiction, the starts and stops in the potential of the various phases of this civilization, combined with brutal intrigues, make for riveting reading. I’m looking forward to getting to volume three this summer.Owen Novak

 Scribner, 2006
By Kathy ReichsReichs is a fantastic writer. This is the fifth of her books that I’ve read. I love the Montreal connection. She even mentions the Guy-Concordia metro station in one of her books! She always keeps it interesting. Her pacing is good, and she’s not long-winded.Kerry McElroy

Little, Brown and Company (1996)
By David Foster WallaceThere's no time like summer to tackle the 1,000-page mammoths of literature like Infinite Jest or Ulysses. While everyone else is getting fit and tan, you'll be sitting in the house reading maniacally — but you'll feel pretty accomplished if you can actually pull it off in a summer!Viviane Namaste

Pluto Press, 2012
By Justin PodurA compelling examination of the ways in which power in Haiti is not located in the state itself, but rather within the terrain of international aid, development projects, coups d'états and non-governmental organizations. This is a great introduction to the histories and complexities of political economy and foreign aid in Haiti.Greg Hannah

Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1963
By Kurt VonnegutIt’s a very easy read and a bitterly ironic and satiric take on the arms race and Armageddon.Mary Caple

Grasset, 2012
By Cédric VillaniThis book is simply unique! Ask a Fields Medal winner to write a book on how he managed to prove, with a collaborator, an important theorem, and you end up with a "road trip" from Tokyo to Princeton and from Lyon to Hyderabad.More than proving a theorem, this book has the enormous merit of proving that significant scientific achievements are full of ups and downs and that persistence is the key to discovery.Ana Cappelluto

Little, Brown and Company, 2014
By Nina StibbeThis is a laugh-out-loud story about the everyday challenges of a very particular family. In 1982, 20-year-old Nina Stibbe moved from Leicester to London to take up a post as a nanny. Her two charges were the children of Mary-Kay Wilmers, long-time editor of the London Review of Books, and her ex-husband, the film director Stephen Frears. Her observant, crisp and funny collection of letters home to her sister, Vic, make up the entirety of Love, Nina.Lea Prevel Katsanis

Hogarth, 2013
By Herman KochThis is a dark and chilling story about two families faced with an impossible decision that must be made over one dinner. You feel that you're a diner in the restaurant watching from another table. A great read! Charles Gedeon

 Penguin Books, 2013
By Ruth OzekiThis novel revolves around the diary of a suicidal teenager found on the beach by a Japanese-Canadian woman. Inside, she finds a cocktail of Zen Buddhism and Japanese culture, which she contrasts with her rural Canadian lifestyle.With its themes of civic duty and life versus death, this book will make you think deeply about what it means to be a human in society while entertaining you with some light fiction and very interesting characters.Alexandra Panaccio

HarperCollins, 1997
By Bryan BurroughThe author tells the incredible true story of how a joint Russian and American crew narrowly survived almost every trauma an astronaut could imagine: fire, power blackouts, chemical leaks, docking failures, nail-biting space walks and constant mechanical breakdowns, all climaxing in a dramatic mid-space collision that left everyone scrambling for their lives.I do team building with astronauts who recommended this book. With today's interest in Mars One and Chris Hadfield's recent return from his six-month space mission, I think this book is a must. I just loved it. Over the years it has become one of my favourite books.Josip Novakovich
