Television might show you fiery exchanges from the most recent Question Period. But what really goes on in Parliament? And how might our legislatures work better?

The Honourable Don Boudria comes as a seasoned politician with over 20 years of experience, ready to take you on an insightful journey that explains the workings of Canada’s federal legislature.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
