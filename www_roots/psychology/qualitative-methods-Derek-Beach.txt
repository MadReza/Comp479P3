Dr. Beach will discuss their benefits and drawbacks, and how they can be combined to create robust designs that enable strong causal inferences to be made.Professor Beach will then take you right into the action and teach you the nuts and bolts of how causal theories may be empirically studied using case study designs. More importantly, this workshop will demonstrate how causal case study methods may be applied to public policy research.If you like testing theories, this is a workshop for you!Find out how to register
