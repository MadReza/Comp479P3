Concordia is one of Montreal’s Top 30 Employers for 2016. The university has been named to the list along with 29 other organizations, which lead their sectors in attracting and retaining employees, by the editors of the Canada’s Top 100 Employers.“I’m not surprised that people are taking notice of Concordia,” says Concordia’s president Alan Shepard. “We have a lot to be proud of when it comes to the services and programs we offer to staff and faculty. We’re honoured to be recognized as one of the top 30 employers in Montreal.”In making their selection, the competition editors were impressed by the university’s many employee programs including health benefits that extend to retirees, family-friendly benefits, retirement planning assistance services, and access to on-campus fitness facilities at reduced rates.“Concordia is ultimately about people,” Shepard says. “That’s why we offer opportunities to our staff and faculty to become engaged in planning for our future, to participate in continuous learning activities and to make contributions to the community.”Concordia was evaluated on the full complement of programs that support its faculty and staff. For example, family-friendly policies such as onsite daycare; the physical environment on campus that includes onsite art galleries, libraries, greenspaces and performance venues; employee communications like the staff and faculty newsletter; and opportunities for community involvement such as participating in the annual community campaign, Centraide, and volunteering through the LIVE Centre.
