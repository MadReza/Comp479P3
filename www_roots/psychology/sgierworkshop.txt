http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/polisci/wssr/2015/05/25/sgierworkshop.htmlThis three-day workshop aims to introduce students and participants to the basics of social science discourse analysis.

Professor Lea Sgier will start with an introduction to the theoretical and epistemological bases of discourses analysis, and move on to practical exercises whose aim is to illustrate how discourse analytical research is concretely done.

These exercises will also contend with concerns such as validity criteria and the limits of interpretation.

Finally, this workshop will briefly consider various “schools” of discourse analysis and discuss the usefulness of discourse analytical work for various disciplines.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
