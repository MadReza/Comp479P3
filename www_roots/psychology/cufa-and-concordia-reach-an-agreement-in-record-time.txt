At its meeting on September 16, Concordia’s Board of Governors ratified the agreement-in-principle reached with the Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA). It was ratified by CUFA’s membership a week before.“Our members are pleased with the outcome in this difficult fiscal environment,” said Ted Stathopoulos, president of CUFA. “We had a respectful round of bargaining with a sincere effort from both sides to understand each other’s positions and concerns and move forward.”“I want to thank both negotiating teams and the leadership of CUFA for their professionalism, hard work, creativity and collegiality,” said Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs. “They can take pride in how well they worked together to come to a positive agreement as quickly as they did.”The last agreement expired on May 31, 2015. The new agreement comes into effect once both parties sign it. Following the signing, which will take place shortly, the documents will be posted on Concordia’s website.
