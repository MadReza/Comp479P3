http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/polisci/wssr/all-guest-lecturers/guywhitten.htmlGuy D. Whitten is a Professor in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University. He is also the Director of the European Union Center and the Director of the Program in Scientific Political Methodology.

Dr. Whitten's primary research and teaching interests are political economy, public policy, political methodology, and comparative politics. Much of his published research has involved cross-national comparative studies of the influence of economics on government popularity and elections. His recent research in public policy includes work on the politics of defense spending in parliamentary democracies. Dr. Whitten has also published a number of works on the use of statistics to make inferences in political science. Together with Paul Kellstedt, Dr. Whitten has written a textbook titledThe Fundamentals of Political Science Research (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press 2013). He is an active reviewer of manuscripts, and currently serves on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Political Science, Electoral Studies, and Political Science Research and Methods.

Dr. Whitten is a frequent instructor of short courses on statistical methods for social scientists and other analysts of observational data at a number of international universities and research centers. These include the Essex School in Social Science Data Analysis at the University of Essex (United Kingdom), the International Political Science Association's Summer Schools on Concepts, Methods and Techniques in Political Science (in both São Paulo and Singapore), Concordia University (Montreal), and the International Crane Foundation (Cuba). His methodological specialties include models of discrete dependent variables and dynamic processes.

This five-day workshop, offered through the ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research, will teach students how to conduct multivariate analyses of social, economic and political data. Several valuable tools for academic researchers in the social sciences and analysts in the public and private sectors will be considered.
