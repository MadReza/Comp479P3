9:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.This workshop teaches students how to conduct multivariate analyses of social, economic and political data. Several valuable tools for academic researchers in the social sciences and analysts in the public and private sectors are considered. The course first focuses on discrete choice models, including the mixed logit model, for analyzing factors affecting choices individuals make in social, economic and political environments. The course then considers time series methods for studying policy interventions and the dynamics of policy outcomes.

Topics covered include ARIMA models for interventions and forecasting, error correction models of cointegrated processes, dynamic panel models and ARCH models of volatility and risk.

Assuming only familiarity with the standard OLS regression model, the course emphasizes practical applications with real data and students will learn how to use major statistical software packages such as Stata, R and Rats in their research.

Students are invited to bring their own data sets to lab sessions.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University

Throughout the course, the emphases will be on how to conduct and present sound analyses and strategies for learning new techniques.We begin with a review/crash course in the linear multiple regression model, and then move on to other important multivariate models including binomial logit and probit models, the multinomial logit model and the mixed logit model.The workshop then considers the interpretation of interaction effects in linear and nonlinear models as well as multilevel models that analyze how socio-economic and political contexts influence individual behavior. Time series and pooled time series methods that investigate how factors such as policy interventions and socio-economic conditions affect dynamic outcomes also are considered.Additional topics, such as the analysis of spatial statistical models will be covered, based on student interests and time availability. Assuming only familiarity with introductory statistics, the workshop emphasizes practical approaches to analyzing individual- and aggregate-level social science data. Participants are invited to bring their own data sets to daily lab sessions.Want more information about registration for credit?
