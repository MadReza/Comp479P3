http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2013/11/28/laptop-loss-is-thelastthingyouneedrightnow.htmlWhen exam season kicks off, Concordia’s libraries and study spaces are always packed with students around the clock.With that in mind, the university security team wants you to be especially aware of your surroundings, and to watch your belongings all times.“It only takes a few seconds to have your laptop stolen. The time it takes to get up to go to the washroom — or even to shut your eyes for a quick rest — is more than enough to lose everything,” says Lyne Denis, an investigator and theft preventionist with Security.1.    Bring only what you need for the dayAre you lugging around everything and the kitchen sink? Is your wallet overstuffed with a myriad of credit and identification cards?Don’t put all your belongings at risk. Carry only what is absolutely necessary: your Concordia ID, health card, bank card and OPUS card, some cash, and your laptop and your books.2.    Keep your valuables in sight at all timesDon’t leave your backpack or purse on the back of your chair, on the floor, or on the seat beside you. Turn away and when you turn back again, it could be gone.Need to powder your nose? Bring your valuables with you. Don’t rely on strangers to watch your belongings — they may be distracted by their own studying.3.    Trust your instinctsBe aware of your surroundings at all times and listen to your instincts. As Denis says, “If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.”Concordia security agents regularly patrol the libraries, but they can’t be everywhere at once. If you notice any suspicious people or activities, please call Security immediately at 514-848-3717. 

Stay safe and happy studying!
