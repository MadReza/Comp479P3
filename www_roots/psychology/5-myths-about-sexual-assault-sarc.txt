Jennifer Drummond spends a lot of her time busting myths related to sexual assault.As coordinator of Concordia’s Sexual Assault Resource Centre (SARC), Drummond delivers workshops to everyone from Stingers athletes to first-year students attending Orientation to help them better understand the concept of consent in an intimate relationship.She emphasizes the importance of understanding that sexual assault is about the perpetrator exerting power and control, not about love, desire or sexuality.When it comes to sexual assault, here are the top five myths Drummond is trying to bust:Fact: Someone known to the survivor, including acquaintances, dating partners and common-law or married partners commit approximately 82 per cent of sexual assaults.Fact: The majority of sexual assaults happen in a private home or apartment.Fact: Any unwanted sexual contact is considered to be sexual violence. A survivor can be severely affected by all forms of sexual violence, including unwanted fondling, rubbing, kissing or other sexual acts.Many forms of sexual violence involve no physical contact, such as stalking or distributing intimate visual recordings. All of these acts are serious and can be damaging.Fact: Just because a survivor doesn’t report the assault doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Fewer than one in 10 survivors report the crime to law enforcement.Fact: If someone is unconscious or incapable of consenting due to the use of alcohol or drugs, they cannot legally give consent. Without consent, it is sexual assault. Concordia’s Sexual Assault Resouce Centre has resources to help you better understand sexual assault and consent.

Myth #2: Sexual assault is most likely to happen outside in dark, dangerous places.

Myth #4: If a person who was sexually assaulted doesn’t report the incident to the police, it wasn’t sexual assault.
Myth #5: It’s not a big deal to have sex with someone while they are drunk, stoned or passed out.Study resourcesCalendar - GraduateCalendar - UndergraduateClass schedulesClass cancellationsCourse registrationImportant academic datesMore academic resourcesCampus servicesConcordia storesIT servicesJob opportunitiesSecurityShuttle busStudent Service Centre (Birks)All campus servicesWhat's newCalendar of eventsLatest newsMedia RelationsFaculties, Schools & CollegesArts and ScienceEngineering and Computer ScienceFine ArtsJohn Molson School of BusinessSchool of Graduate StudiesAll Schools, Colleges & DepartmentsStudy resources
