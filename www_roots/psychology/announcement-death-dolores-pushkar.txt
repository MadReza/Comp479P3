http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/artsci/psychology/2015/09/21/announcement-death-dolores-pushkar.htmlI am very sorry to inform you of the death of Dolores Pushkar, long-time faculty member and respected colleague.
 
Her daughters, Leslie and Alice, will be hosting a celebration of Dolores' life here at the University on Monday September 21 from 4-7 p.m. in the RF building (7141 Sherbrooke St. West).  They welcome anyone who wishes to share their memories of Dolores and ask that you share this invitation with those who you feel would like to attend.
 
The obituary will appear in the Gazette on Wednesday or Thursday this week.
 
I am sorry for the loss that I know we all feel, and I look forward to coming together to remember a remarkable member of the department and the university.
 
Regards,
