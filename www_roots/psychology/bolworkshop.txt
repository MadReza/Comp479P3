9:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Fuzzy Sets are more and more popular in political and social sciences. These methods are geared towards systematic cross-case comparison, a synthesis between case-oriented and variable-oriented approaches, and an emphasis on causal complexity.Since they rely on Boolean (instead of linear) algebra, they are also better suited for testing necessity and sufficiency causal relations than traditional quantitative methods.

The goal of this short course is to introduce QCA and Fuzzy Sets. It combines theoretical lectures and practical hands-on exercises on computers. At the end, students should be able to conduct a standard research using these methods by themselves.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
