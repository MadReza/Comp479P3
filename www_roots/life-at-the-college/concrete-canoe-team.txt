http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/alumni-friends/giving-to-concordia/our-campaigns/community-campaign/fundone/past-projects/concrete-canoe-team.htmlTo raise $7,000 to help cover construction and competition costs for participation in the 2016 Canadian National Concrete Canoe Competition, where engineering students from all over the country converge to race canoes they design and build — entirely out of concrete!The 2016 Canadian National Concrete Canoe Competition runs May 13 to 15, 2016, at McGill University.Teams must build canoes measuring 20 feet long, up to three feet wide and able to float with four passengers. We'll be judged on the canoe’s construction, our oral presentation and display illustrating the construction process, and the canoe's performance in five different races.We'll soon begin testing and manufacturing, which will continue through the winter semester. Why we need your helpThis is our first year participating in the competition, so we are starting from scratch. We need tools, equipment and in some cases, training. In addition to buying the construction materials, we also need help covering competition costs including registration, travel, accommodation, paddles, lifejackets and above all transportation of the canoe. The Concordia Concrete Canoe Team is made up of 30 motivated students, mostly in civil engineering, with a few from mechanical and building engineering.Leading our team are Captain Hyacinth Domagala and Co-Captain Paraskevas Mylonas, both civil engineering undergraduate students.For more information, please contact us at canoe.csce@ecaconcordia.ca or visit our website and Facebook page.You'll be invited to attend the competition taking place May 13-15, 2016, at McGill University.Questions?
