This is motivated by the need to develop new technologies and methodologies allowing for more intelligent critical infrastructure that operate reliably and safely in presence of attacks/faults. The main research goals and objectives are to design and develop attack monitoring and attack resilient control recovery methodologies and toolkits that are characterized by their general features that enable them to be a component of the next generation of 24/7-available distributed critical infrastructure systems. Attack detection, isolation, and identification as well as attack resilient control and recovery are the main and important aspects of security of CPS systems. Specifically, these solutions and schemes aim at detecting the existence of malicious attacks, identify their actions, and reconfigure/recover the control strategies to counter and compensate for the degradations as a result of attacks. The overall objective of this project is to address various aspects of CPS system security with special emphasis on utilizing diagnostics and fault tolerant and resilient control strategies to develop schemes for improving reliability and resilience of these safety critical systems subject to multiple types of malicious attacks.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
