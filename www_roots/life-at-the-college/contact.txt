She began her career in human resources working in both the private and the public sectors where, in the latter, she specialized in recruitment and compensation.She later moved on to the position of Career Advisor in Concordia’s Career and Placement Service Office where she met with students to provide job search advice. She also organized various on-campus events, including career fairs and career panel discussions.  She also liaised with employers inviting them on campus to recruit and hire Concordia students.In her role as Coordinator for the Francisation Program and Oui Can Help!, Chanel brings a well-developed skill set to help connect students to French language resources both within Concordia, as well as throughout the city.  It is hoped that these resources may increase students’ chances of securing part-time and/or full-time employment in Quebec, and consequently provide incentive for them to remain in the province and contribute in a positive manner to Quebec society.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityContactDépartement d'études françaises
