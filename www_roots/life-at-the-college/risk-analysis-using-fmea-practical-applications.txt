Room EV001.162I will talk about FMEA, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. This is a risk analysis methodology used for development of product, process, machine etc. This approach is widely used in the automotive industry and other industries. It provides a systematic teamwork approach for qualitative risks analysis and is a good tool for continuous improvement. We will see the history, the principles and the implementation steps of this methodology. We will talk about a few examples from the industry and also use a couple of examples coming from daily life. Thierry Carpentier is a supplier quality manager in batteries for electric vehicles, bus and stationary applications at BlueSolutions based at Boucherville. He has a 15 year work experience in quality management (quality management, supplier quality, project quality) in the automotive, aerospace and transportation industries in Quebec and France.
