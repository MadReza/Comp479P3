To open a bank account, go to the “New Accounts” department at a bank. A bank employee will explain the different types of accounts and the costs and services associated with each type of account. It is a good idea to check with several banks to determine which bank offers the best account for your needs. In most banks, it is possible to open a bank account by showing your passport, your Concordia Letter of Admission or I.D. card, your Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ), and Study Permit. You will also be asked to show a copy of your apartment lease as proof of residency in Montreal.
