http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/transfer-students.htmlIf you’re interested in transferring to Concordia from another university, we consider your transfer application on the basis of both your university studies and your previous studies. When you transfer from another accredited university to Concordia, we will consider placing you at an appropriate level within the undergraduate program of your choice.Academic credit may be awarded for university-level courses that are equivalent to Concordia courses and appropriate to the program you are applying to.There are, however, some special conditions attached to the granting of transfer credits. The number of credits awarded depends on the character, quality and quantity of the work completed.For more information on transferring from other post-secondary institutions refer to the Undergraduate Calendar.Are you a Concordia student currently enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree and wish to apply for a transfer into a different Bachelor’s degree?  (e.g. from a Bachelor of Commerce to Bachelor of Fine Arts or from Bachelor of Arts  to a Bachelor of Engineering). If you wish to apply to transfer from one degree to another, view How to apply for a Degree Transfer.NOTE: If you are currently in a Certificate or are Independent student who wishes to apply to enter a Bachelor’s program you must apply for admission.(for currently registered Concordia students in a Bachelor’s degree program)*Applications to Computation Arts must be submitted by the deadline dates stipulated by the Faculty of Fine Arts.Late applications will be considered if places are still available for the fall term only.(for currently registered Concordia students in a Bachelor’s degree program)Students seeking transfer to the Faculty of Arts and Science (or those seeking to transfer from Arts to Science or vice-versa) are expected to have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 over their entire Concordia record. Many programs in Arts and Science are subject to quotas or limited enrolment. A higher cumulative GPA may be required for admission to certain programs (for example, the minimum requirements for transfer to Economics is a cumulative GPA of 2.60 and 24 credits completed at Concordia. The minimum requirements for transfer to Psychology or Exercise Science, Exercise Science: Clinical Exercise Physiology or Athletic Therapy, are a cumulative GPA of 3.00 and 24 credits completed at Concordia).Moreover, some programs have additional requirements, e.g. interview, letter of intent, portfolio. For the following programs, students should contact the appropriate department for selection criteria for internal transfer as early as possible: Actuarial Math/Finance, Communication Studies, Community Service, Community, Public Affairs and Policy Studies, Creative Writing, Early Childhood and Elementary Education, Family Life Education, Human Relations, Individually Structured Program, Journalism, Leisure Sciences, Modern Arabic Language and Culture, Modern Chinese Language (Mandarin) and Culture, Pastoral Caregiving, TESL, Therapeutic Recreation, Specialization in Traduction, Western Society and Culture.Applicants must have completed a minimum of 12 applicable credits at Concordia prior to being considered for a degree transfer. Applicants seeking transfer to competitive Engineering programs should have completed a number of the required prerequisites with above average grades prior to applying for transfer.In general, students applying to any of the Engineering and Computer Science programs should have a minimum GPA in the 2.50 range to be considered for transfer. All programs in the Faculty are competitive; therefore, meeting the minimum cumulative/annual GPA requirement does not guarantee entry into competitive programs. Grades obtained in prerequisite courses and core program courses will carry significant weight in this decision.For the Winter Term (January entry), applicants must have already completed a minimum of 12 credits. Courses in progress will not be factored into any January entry decision; therefore, students admitted to the University in the previous September are not eligible for a degree transfer into the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.Entry is selective and competitive and in most areas is based on a portfolio and/or interview and/or audition. As there is a quota for each program in the Faculty of Fine Arts, it is not possible to indicate a grade requirement. The final selection will be influenced by the number of available places and the number and quality of applicants.Deadline dates for the submission of portfolios or to arrange interviews and/or auditions vary by department. For specific information on portfolio/interview/audition requirements and deadline dates, applicants should consult the specific department in the Faculty of Fine Arts.Applicants for transfer to either the BComm or BAdmin program must meet the following requirements:Applicants who have been placed in Failed Standing in their program at Concordia will not be considered for transfer to JMSB programs.Such students must first apply for readmission to their current program, upgrade their academic standing by completing 24 to 30 credits, achieving a minimum CGPA of 2.70 for the courses completed after readmission to their program, and meeting requirements 2 and 3 above. Transfer credits for courses completed prior to re-admission will not be awarded..© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityTransfer studentsUndergraduate admissions
