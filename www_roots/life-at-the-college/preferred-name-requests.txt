In the privacy of this appointment, the student will be asked to provide a valid ID and sign a “Request to use Preferred Name” form. A new Student ID card will be created at the Birks Student Service Centre, which will notify the student for pick-up when it is ready. The preferred name will then be used on all unofficial documents in the future.Office of the Registrar© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityPreferred name requestsStudent hub
