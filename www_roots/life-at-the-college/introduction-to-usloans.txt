http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/financial-support/government-loans/usa/introduction-to-usloans.htmlEffective July 1, 2010, the US Department of Education requires all schools disbursing US government loans to do so through the US Government's William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. This means that the US government will be electronically disbursing student loan funding directly to schools without the participation of any third parties (i.e, banks or financial institutions).Under the Direct Loan program, your lender is the United States Department of Education.The Borrower is the person who borrows money through the US Government's William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. For certain loans, your parents may be the borrowers.The Financial Aid and Awards Office (FAAO) at Concordia University works with you and your parents to determine your eligibility for different types of loans based on US federal guidelines. The FAAO also approves your federal loan application and the amount you can borrow. It reports enrolments and other information about Direct Loan borrowers to the US government, and is responsible for complying with US laws and regulations governing the Direct Loan program.The US Federal Government is responsible for the disbursement of Direct Loan funds. In the Direct Loan program, funding is transferred directly to schools without the particpation of third parties (such as banks or other financial institutions). The US Department of Education is your lender.Direct Subsidized Loans are available for undergraduate degree students. Eligibility is based on financial need as defined by the US Department of Education. "Subsidized" means that the US government pays the interest while you are studying at least half-time. The government also pays the interest during any authorized period of deferment and for the grace period.Stafford Unsubsidized Loans are available for undergraduate, graduate degree students. Eligibility is not based on financial need. You are responsible for paying the interest from the time the money is disbursed. The interest may be paid as it is due or it may be postponed and allowed to accumulate while you are in school as well as during any authorized period of deferment and during the grace period. If payments are postponed, the interest accrues and is capitalized (added to the amount you borrowed). Capitalized interest must then be paid back with the loan after any authorized period of deferment or after the grace period.150% RuleIf you are a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013, there is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. This time limit does not apply to Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans. If this limit applies to you, you may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. This is called your “maximum eligibility period.” Your maximum eligibility period is based on the published length of your current program.For example, if you are enrolled in a four-year bachelor’s degree program, the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is six years (150 percent of 4 years = 6 years).Because your maximum eligibility period is based on the length of your current program of study, your maximum eligibility period can change if you change to a program that has a different length.Also, if you receive Direct Subsidized Loans for one program and then change to another program, the Direct Subsidized Loans you received for the earlier program will generally count toward your new maximum eligibility period.Certain types of enrollment may cause you to become responsible for the interest that accrues on your Direct Subsidized Loans when the U.S. Department of Education usually would have paid it.  The following chart provides maximum annual and total loan limits for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans as of July 1, 2012.$57,500 for undergraduates—No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.$138,500 for graduate or professional students—No more than $65,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. The graduate debt limit includes all federal loans received for undergraduate study.Note: The maximum total loan limits include any Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans you may have received under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. As a result of legislation, no further loans are made under the FFEL Program as of July 1, 2010.Graduate and professional students enrolled in certain health profession programs may receive additional unsubsidized Direct Loan amounts each academic year beyond those shown above. For these students, there is also an increased aggregate loan limit of $224,000 (maximum $65,500 subsidized).Federal Parents PLUS Loans are available for parents who meet certain credit guidelines and whose child is a dependent undergraduate student as defined by the US Department of Education. Eligibility is not based on financial need. Parents may use this loan to pay the entire cost of attendance minus any other financial aid received by their dependent undergraduate student. Repayment is due to commence within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed, although deferment of payment may be available through select lenders. This loan does not have a grace period.Federal Graduate PLUS Loans are available for graduate and professional students. Before July 1st, 2006, this loan was only available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. Graduate students may borrow this loan to cover the difference between cost of attendance and all other awarded aid after applying for other Federal aid. This loan has a federal credit check process. The review looks for bad credit only. You do not have to meet other financial standards as with other private alternative loans. Repayment is due to commence within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed, although deferment of payment may be available. This loan does not have a grace period.The maximum PLUS loan amount that a parent or graduate and professional degree student can borrow is the student's cost of attendance as calculated by the University minus any other financial aid the student receives. Alternative loans are private, non-governmental funds that are available if you need additional sources of funding. You may borrow up to your cost of attendance (COA) minus any other financial aid that you receive for that aid year. Alternative loans have different interest rates, fees and repayment options than US government loans. A co-signer may also be required. Some lenders offer borrower benefits that reduce your loan balance or lower your interest rates. If you are not registered in a degree program, you may still apply for alternative loans. Please keep in mind that it is your decision which loan product you choose. The FAAO will certify any alternative loan that you choose provided the organization accepts that you are attending an institution outside of the US.Application Process for a US alternative loan Receiving your US alternative loanAll students receive their alternative loan funds by cheque in two or three equal disbursements.You must: Federal regulations require that the University tracks the academic progress of student loan recipients from the first date of enrolment at Concordia University, whether or not loans were received at that time. Credits transferred from all other credit sources will be considered as attempted and completed credits in the evaluation of the completion rate standards, but these courses do not affect the calculation of your GPA.In order to be eligible for US loans, you must meet Concordia University's institutional requirements for minimum satisfactory performance. These are defined in the Undergraduate and the Graduate Calendar under each Faculty's section. Note that you must maintain a minimum annual GPA of 2.0 in all Undergraduate Faculties and 3.0 for Graduate Faculties.DISC, INC, MED, DEF, AU, F/FNS/R/NR & S Grades, and repeated course work will be treated as follows: Satisfactory Academic Progress for Titile IV Aid RecipientsThe following policy applies to Title IV aid recipients who are considered to be full-time, quarter-time or part-time in undergraduate or graduate level studies in the Title IV aid-eligible programs.As a student loan recipient, you are rquired to be in good standing, maintain satisfactory academic progess toward your degree requirements for each semester in which you are enrolled, and complete your degree in the prescribed period according to your program.  Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), as described below, is evaluated on an annual basis in June.  Note, that Satisfactory academic Progress for Title IV aid recipients is stricter than the university's regulations as pace of progression in addition to academic performances are measured.  Failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress may result in the cancellation of your Title IV aid. Basic Standard for Satisfactory Academic ProgressTo achieve SAP as per the US Department of Education, students must:            ANDAlso, the financial aid office will ensure that students are completing their educational program within a time frame no longer than 150% of its published length. (For example, a student must complete their program after attempting a maximum of 180 credits for a 120-credit program).Furthermore, for students enrolled in an educational program of more than two academic years, must have a minimum CUMULATIVE GPA of 2.0 or have the academic standing consistent within their faculty's published requirements for graduation.Example of ideal pace of progression for an undergraduate student:0 -  30 credits = year 130 - 60 credits = year 2 (with a minimum Cummulative GPA of 2.0 or more)60 - 90 credits = year 390 - 120 credits = year 4For graduate students, the maximum timeframe will be defined by the School of Graduate Studies upon admission and will be monitored and evaluated on an annual basis.  If you fail to meet the minimum 2.0 annual Grade Point Average standard, or fail to complete at least two-thirds of cumulative credits attempted, you will immediately lose your eligibility for Title IV funding. No Title IV financial aid will be disbursed to you unless you are removed from Student Loan Denied status.If you fail to satisfy the 150% requirement, you will also be placed on Student Loan Denied status. No aid will be disbursed unless you have made an appeal and the appeal is granted. There are no exceptions to this requirement. If you are in a 120-credit bachelor degree program and have attempted in excess of 180 credits including transfer credits, you are no longer eligible for financial aid.All Title IV aid recipients who fail any of the above noted Satisfactory Academic Progress standards will be notified by e-mail within 1 week of the determination to advise they have been placed on Student Loan Denied Status, and given a specific date to submit their appeal (if applicable). Reinstatement of Aid After Student Loan Denied Status.Reinstatement of financial aid after you have been placed on Student Loan Denied status may be achieved in one of the following ways:You attend Concordia University, pay for tuition and fees without the help of government financial aid, and do well enough in the course work to meet all the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. You regain aid eligibility in a probationary status.You must submit a written appeal in accordance with the appeal process. If the FAAO grants the appeal, you will then be placed on Student Loan Probation for ONE payment period. You must attain a minimum 2.0 GPA in that payment period to qualify for the second disbursement. The student's next academic evaluation will use the term GPA of the 1st payment period of the aid year. This evaluation will normally be done in September, December or May, after which time if your GPA is not above the 2.0 minimum or pace progression has not been attained, you will immediately be placed on US Federal Loan Suspension and become ineligible for any futher Title IV aid until all of the above noted minimum academic requirements have been met.You may appeal your "Student Loan Denied Status" if it can be determined that an unusual or extraordinary situation affected your academic progress.

            Concordia University requirements for satisfactory academic progressStudent Loan Denied StatusAppeal ProcessConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/financial-support/government-loans/usa/introduction-to-usloans.htmlEffective July 1, 2010, the US Department of Education requires all schools disbursing US government loans to do so through the US Government's William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. This means that the US government will be electronically disbursing student loan funding directly to schools without the participation of any third parties (i.e, banks or financial institutions).Under the Direct Loan program, your lender is the United States Department of Education.The Borrower is the person who borrows money through the US Government's William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. For certain loans, your parents may be the borrowers.The Financial Aid and Awards Office (FAAO) at Concordia University works with you and your parents to determine your eligibility for different types of loans based on US federal guidelines. The FAAO also approves your federal loan application and the amount you can borrow. It reports enrolments and other information about Direct Loan borrowers to the US government, and is responsible for complying with US laws and regulations governing the Direct Loan program.The US Federal Government is responsible for the disbursement of Direct Loan funds. In the Direct Loan program, funding is transferred directly to schools without the particpation of third parties (such as banks or other financial institutions). The US Department of Education is your lender.Direct Subsidized Loans are available for undergraduate degree students. Eligibility is based on financial need as defined by the US Department of Education. "Subsidized" means that the US government pays the interest while you are studying at least half-time. The government also pays the interest during any authorized period of deferment and for the grace period.Stafford Unsubsidized Loans are available for undergraduate, graduate degree students. Eligibility is not based on financial need. You are responsible for paying the interest from the time the money is disbursed. The interest may be paid as it is due or it may be postponed and allowed to accumulate while you are in school as well as during any authorized period of deferment and during the grace period. If payments are postponed, the interest accrues and is capitalized (added to the amount you borrowed). Capitalized interest must then be paid back with the loan after any authorized period of deferment or after the grace period.150% RuleIf you are a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013, there is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. This time limit does not apply to Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans. If this limit applies to you, you may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. This is called your “maximum eligibility period.” Your maximum eligibility period is based on the published length of your current program.For example, if you are enrolled in a four-year bachelor’s degree program, the maximum period for which you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans is six years (150 percent of 4 years = 6 years).Because your maximum eligibility period is based on the length of your current program of study, your maximum eligibility period can change if you change to a program that has a different length.Also, if you receive Direct Subsidized Loans for one program and then change to another program, the Direct Subsidized Loans you received for the earlier program will generally count toward your new maximum eligibility period.Certain types of enrollment may cause you to become responsible for the interest that accrues on your Direct Subsidized Loans when the U.S. Department of Education usually would have paid it.  The following chart provides maximum annual and total loan limits for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans as of July 1, 2012.$57,500 for undergraduates—No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.$138,500 for graduate or professional students—No more than $65,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. The graduate debt limit includes all federal loans received for undergraduate study.Note: The maximum total loan limits include any Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans or Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans you may have received under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. As a result of legislation, no further loans are made under the FFEL Program as of July 1, 2010.Graduate and professional students enrolled in certain health profession programs may receive additional unsubsidized Direct Loan amounts each academic year beyond those shown above. For these students, there is also an increased aggregate loan limit of $224,000 (maximum $65,500 subsidized).Federal Parents PLUS Loans are available for parents who meet certain credit guidelines and whose child is a dependent undergraduate student as defined by the US Department of Education. Eligibility is not based on financial need. Parents may use this loan to pay the entire cost of attendance minus any other financial aid received by their dependent undergraduate student. Repayment is due to commence within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed, although deferment of payment may be available through select lenders. This loan does not have a grace period.Federal Graduate PLUS Loans are available for graduate and professional students. Before July 1st, 2006, this loan was only available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students. Graduate students may borrow this loan to cover the difference between cost of attendance and all other awarded aid after applying for other Federal aid. This loan has a federal credit check process. The review looks for bad credit only. You do not have to meet other financial standards as with other private alternative loans. Repayment is due to commence within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed, although deferment of payment may be available. This loan does not have a grace period.The maximum PLUS loan amount that a parent or graduate and professional degree student can borrow is the student's cost of attendance as calculated by the University minus any other financial aid the student receives. Alternative loans are private, non-governmental funds that are available if you need additional sources of funding. You may borrow up to your cost of attendance (COA) minus any other financial aid that you receive for that aid year. Alternative loans have different interest rates, fees and repayment options than US government loans. A co-signer may also be required. Some lenders offer borrower benefits that reduce your loan balance or lower your interest rates. If you are not registered in a degree program, you may still apply for alternative loans. Please keep in mind that it is your decision which loan product you choose. The FAAO will certify any alternative loan that you choose provided the organization accepts that you are attending an institution outside of the US.Application Process for a US alternative loan Receiving your US alternative loanAll students receive their alternative loan funds by cheque in two or three equal disbursements.You must: Federal regulations require that the University tracks the academic progress of student loan recipients from the first date of enrolment at Concordia University, whether or not loans were received at that time. Credits transferred from all other credit sources will be considered as attempted and completed credits in the evaluation of the completion rate standards, but these courses do not affect the calculation of your GPA.In order to be eligible for US loans, you must meet Concordia University's institutional requirements for minimum satisfactory performance. These are defined in the Undergraduate and the Graduate Calendar under each Faculty's section. Note that you must maintain a minimum annual GPA of 2.0 in all Undergraduate Faculties and 3.0 for Graduate Faculties.DISC, INC, MED, DEF, AU, F/FNS/R/NR & S Grades, and repeated course work will be treated as follows: Satisfactory Academic Progress for Titile IV Aid RecipientsThe following policy applies to Title IV aid recipients who are considered to be full-time, quarter-time or part-time in undergraduate or graduate level studies in the Title IV aid-eligible programs.As a student loan recipient, you are rquired to be in good standing, maintain satisfactory academic progess toward your degree requirements for each semester in which you are enrolled, and complete your degree in the prescribed period according to your program.  Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), as described below, is evaluated on an annual basis in June.  Note, that Satisfactory academic Progress for Title IV aid recipients is stricter than the university's regulations as pace of progression in addition to academic performances are measured.  Failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress may result in the cancellation of your Title IV aid. Basic Standard for Satisfactory Academic ProgressTo achieve SAP as per the US Department of Education, students must:            ANDAlso, the financial aid office will ensure that students are completing their educational program within a time frame no longer than 150% of its published length. (For example, a student must complete their program after attempting a maximum of 180 credits for a 120-credit program).Furthermore, for students enrolled in an educational program of more than two academic years, must have a minimum CUMULATIVE GPA of 2.0 or have the academic standing consistent within their faculty's published requirements for graduation.Example of ideal pace of progression for an undergraduate student:0 -  30 credits = year 130 - 60 credits = year 2 (with a minimum Cummulative GPA of 2.0 or more)60 - 90 credits = year 390 - 120 credits = year 4For graduate students, the maximum timeframe will be defined by the School of Graduate Studies upon admission and will be monitored and evaluated on an annual basis.  If you fail to meet the minimum 2.0 annual Grade Point Average standard, or fail to complete at least two-thirds of cumulative credits attempted, you will immediately lose your eligibility for Title IV funding. No Title IV financial aid will be disbursed to you unless you are removed from Student Loan Denied status.If you fail to satisfy the 150% requirement, you will also be placed on Student Loan Denied status. No aid will be disbursed unless you have made an appeal and the appeal is granted. There are no exceptions to this requirement. If you are in a 120-credit bachelor degree program and have attempted in excess of 180 credits including transfer credits, you are no longer eligible for financial aid.All Title IV aid recipients who fail any of the above noted Satisfactory Academic Progress standards will be notified by e-mail within 1 week of the determination to advise they have been placed on Student Loan Denied Status, and given a specific date to submit their appeal (if applicable). Reinstatement of Aid After Student Loan Denied Status.Reinstatement of financial aid after you have been placed on Student Loan Denied status may be achieved in one of the following ways:You attend Concordia University, pay for tuition and fees without the help of government financial aid, and do well enough in the course work to meet all the Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. You regain aid eligibility in a probationary status.You must submit a written appeal in accordance with the appeal process. If the FAAO grants the appeal, you will then be placed on Student Loan Probation for ONE payment period. You must attain a minimum 2.0 GPA in that payment period to qualify for the second disbursement. The student's next academic evaluation will use the term GPA of the 1st payment period of the aid year. This evaluation will normally be done in September, December or May, after which time if your GPA is not above the 2.0 minimum or pace progression has not been attained, you will immediately be placed on US Federal Loan Suspension and become ineligible for any futher Title IV aid until all of the above noted minimum academic requirements have been met.You may appeal your "Student Loan Denied Status" if it can be determined that an unusual or extraordinary situation affected your academic progress. An example of an unusual or extraordinary situation would be a death in the family or a serious illness.Appeals must be:Should you require additional information regarding this process please visit the Financial Aid and Awards Office for additional information.  Award Year: The 12-month period during which you attend the University, and for which your aid has been awarded.Capitalization: The process by which interest is added to the principal loan amount if you choose not to make interest payments while at the University or in forbearance.
