To remain competitive, manufacturers must develop better, more sophisticated, more efficient, more reliable products in less time. In order to accelerate the pace of development and reduce time to market, large and innovative manufacturers like Toyota, GM and Ford use advanced simulators and prototyping systems supplied by OPAL-RT and its competitors as complementary tools to conventional analog test benches.Problem(s) to resolve:
Targeted application(s): Propulsion systems for transportation electrification and interfaces to the power grid as well as mini and micro-grids.Objectives:The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
