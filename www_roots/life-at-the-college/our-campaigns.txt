http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/alumni-friends/giving-to-concordia/our-campaigns.htmlConcordia University’s origins are rooted in philanthropy. The first campus for Loyola College, one of our founding institutions, was built on an apple orchard donated by Giovanni Donegani in the mid-1800s. Since that time, many different gifts, of all sizes and purpose, have shaped Concordia as the forward-thinking, accessible and high-quality institution it is today.Contribute to Concordia’s ongoing advancement by supporting one of our fundraising campaigns.Thousands of donors – alumni, parents, faculty, staff and friends – support the university every year through Concordia's Community Campaign (formerly known as the Annual Giving Campaign).As a Community Campaign donor, you can make a difference to Concordia and its students by contributing to a program, area, or need that is meaningful to you.Regardless of your choice, your annual gift is an expression of your confidence in the university and your generosity will inspire others to follow in your footsteps. Altogether, these contributions afford Concordia the opportunity to offer its students resources and services that wouldn’t be available otherwise.Planned giving is for the living.Making a gift through a will or life-insurance policy, is only part of the story.Think about your charitable giving as part of your financial or estate plan. Planned giving offers you a chance to perpetuate your values and commitment to higher education.You may be fortunate enough to be in a position to make a significant donation to Concordia. Major gifts allow you to have a lasting impact on a project or cause close to your heart.If you are interested in supporting another area of the University, we welcome the opportunity to help make your philanthropic priorities a reality.© Concordia UniversityAdvancement & Alumni Relations, 514-848-2424, ext. 4856Concordia UniversityOur campaignsAlumni & friends
