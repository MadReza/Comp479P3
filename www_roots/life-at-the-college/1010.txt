Greater insomnia difficulties are also associated with greater risk of later cognitive decline. In addition, biomarkers of neurodegeneration have been found associated with short sleep and altered EEG activity during sleep, suggesting that disturbed sleep may contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.The selected postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to work on a research program that will further examine the relationships between sleep, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and cognitive performances in various clinical populations, using a multimodal approach (e.g., EEG, neuroimaging). This program will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of sleep in memory and cognitive decline, and will have clinical implications for future therapeutic approaches.The fellow will have access to Concordia’s PERFORM Center, an 8000m2 facility devoted to health prevention that hosts multiple research platforms such as a Sleep Lab and an Imaging Suite (including a 3-Tesla MRI, SPECT-CT and PET-CT), fully dedicated to research. The PERFORM Sleep Lab, led by Dr. Dang-Vu, includes 3 bedrooms equipped with polysomnography and high-density EEG systems, actigraphy devices and cognitive testing equipment.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
