http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/cissc/working-groups.htmlThe Centre sponsors working groups made up of faculty members and students from different departments who come together to explore topics from multiple disciplinary angles. Activities include discussing readings, presenting works in progress, organizing symposia, staging exhibitions, inviting external speakers. Working groups often lead to the formation of new research teams, or lay the ground for further cross-departmental or cross-faculty collaboration.To submit a working group proposal for the 2017-2018 year please find the application form and details regarding eligibility requirements and the deadline under CISSC Calls. © Concordia UniversityAbout the Centre
