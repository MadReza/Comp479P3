http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/program/courses.htmlThe Science College's unique program complements the student's standard science curriculum by offering a wide variety of cross-disciplinary courses designed especially for Science College students. Physics students, for example, may be required to learn about the biological effects of radiation or about the physiology of vision. Biology students may be required to learn about radiation in the solar system or about the mathematical concepts of symmetry. Such courses are not part of the regular science curriculum and are not offered by traditional science departments. We know, however, that the fast-changing nature of contemporary scientific research does not respect the traditional boundaries between disciplines.See the Undergraduate Calendar for course descriptionsPlease note that students take SCOL 290, SCOL 390 and SCOL 490 every semester.Science College:

Core classes meet weekly during the first two years of the program under the supervision of faculty who are engaged in a diverse range of studio art practices and research activities.At the end of each term students present their work to a review committee composed of faculty, invited artists, curators and critics.Practice-led inquiry is contextualized by critical seminars that provide an interdisciplinary conceptual framework for the development of ideas in relation to creative practice. Seminar topics vary regularly to reflect the shifting nature of contemporary art and culture.Past seminar topics include Living Art: Actions, Interventions, Performance; The Cinematic; Reading Around Deleuze; Quebec Independent Cinema; The Roots of Contemporary Art; Contemporary Art and Aesthetic Judgment; Video Performance-The Body as Site in Video Art; Thinking Through Sound; Art, Place and Public Space and Artist as Researcher.
