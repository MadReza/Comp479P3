Whether you are a student living right on campus or a staff member who travels in and out of the neighbourhood each day, it’s worth taking the time to connect with you surroundings.Located on the west-end of Montreals’s downtown borough, Ville-Marie, the Peter-McGill district is a diverse and eclectic neighbourhood.  The mixture of businesses and cultural institutions, the proximity of the nature-filled Mont-Royal and the plethora of restaurants make Peter-McGill a great place to work, study and live.Making up the south-west half of the Cotes-des-Nieges-Notre-Dame-de-Grace Borough, NDG is home to over 70,000 people.With a diverse population and a healthy mix of commercial and residential space, NDG is known for its unique character and vibrant community-life.
