http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/sgs/university-teaching.htmlThe Graduate Certificate in University Teaching is a 15-credit program designed for current doctoral candidates at Concordia University. The aim of the program is for learners to gain in-depth knowledge about pedagogical practices in post-secondary education and to develop teaching skills in delivering a university course within their area of expertise. Benefiting from the mentorship of experts in university pedagogy and a discipline-specific faculty member, admitted candidates will expand their knowledge about theories of learning and instructional design, as well as enhance their skills in analyzing literature relevant to teaching and learning in higher education. Candidates will also learn to identify appropriate educational resources relevant to their disciplines and make appropriate planning, design and classroom management decisions. All candidates will be required to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to the design, delivery and evaluation of a 3-credit university course.The Graduate Certificate in University Teaching offers a competitive edge to Concordia PhD candidates seeking a tenure-track position. It provides these candidates an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and skills related to university teaching by engaging in an interdisciplinary program of study. Concordia’s Graduate Certificate is grounded in an apprenticeship model through which students are partnered with discipline-specific faculty members, teaching fellows from Concordia’s four faculties as well as teaching and learning consultants. Finally, the capstone requirement to design, develop, implement and evaluate a full 3-credit university course provides invaluable teaching experience within the student’s area of specialization.Students may be eligible for Conference presentation fundingApply through Connect2Concordia* Letters of reference are not required for application to this program.Admissions will be limited to current doctoral students at Concordia in good standing who have been admitted to candidacy, and are on track for a timely completion of their program.
