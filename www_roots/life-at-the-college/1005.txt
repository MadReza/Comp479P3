The GRACE collection of approximately 2500 conditional mutant strains of C. albicans provides the tool to apply genetic analysis to cellular functions in this fungal pathogen. The successful applicant will apply this and derivative libraries to questions related to C. albicans biology. These questions can include topics such as how the pathogen interacts with the mammalian host, how it controls its morphology, and how it regulates signalling and response to the environment. The lab is well equipped for genomic analysis, and houses a Level 2 containment facility for manipulation of the pathogen. Phd in Biology, Biochemistry or related fields; experience in Bioinformatics is an advantage.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
