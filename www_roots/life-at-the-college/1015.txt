The research is in collaboration with the masonry industry in Quebec and Ontario. The main objective of the research is to quantify the seismic performance of RM shear walls with different configurations of confined boundary elements. The specific objectives are focused on the following research areas: (1) to quantify experimentally the enhancement of ductility capacity and seismic performance parameters of scaled models of RM walls with boundary elements with different detailing configurations and confinement levels; (2) to develop experimentally validated analytical models to be used in the framework of performance based design and assessment of RM walls; and (3) to propose code oriented provisions for the design of RM walls with boundary elements for Canadian and American design standards.The postdoctoral fellow will work closely with the research team (Prof. Khaled Galal and the PhD and MSc graduate research students as well as undergraduate research assistants) to ensure achieving the research goals, publishing quality papers, and opening new opportunities for research grants.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
