The platform will integrate the three-dimensional vehicle model, a rolling tire-soil interaction model, advanced suspension models, kineto-dynamics of the frame steering mechanism and a biodynamic model of the occupant. A computationally efficient tire model using the concept of radial rings will be derived from a comprehensive tire-soil interaction model employing smoothed particle hydrodynamic methodology for simulating the soil flows and finite element of tire structure model. The program will also investigate performance potentials of controllable and interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
