Working within the context of the Community and Differential Mobilities cluster (located in Milieux: Institute for Arts Culture and Technology) the PDF will work with a team of researchers and students who are addressing disability discrimination using research-creation as an approach: how can research-creation be used to change able-ist attitudes and practices? Might such a practice be understood as a social innovation? The PDF will bring their own practice, as a critical disability scholar and media-maker, to the cluster and as such share their expertise with researchers, students, artists and activists. They will work with the team to respond on-going requests from the Concordia community on best practices for making arts and cultural events accessible. 3 inter-related 5-10 page white papers by the PDF will be generated over the two-year period that will act as reference points for on-going discussion and debate: one on federal and provincial mandates on disability; a second on social innovations; a third on current debates on research-creation in Canada. The PDF will work for 3 days a week on collective research-creation activities and 2 days of the week on their individual research-creation activities.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
