http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/finearts/music/2016/12/06.htmlTwo choirs in one evening! Jean-Sébastien Allaire leads the largest performing ensemble in the university in this popular concert of choral music. The university choir, made up of students, staff and the community, give their all to celebrate the end of the semester.  Kathy Kennedy directs the chamber choir in a program for a smaller, more intimate choir, singing repertoire from the Renaissance to the present day. The act of singing is one of the most unifying human abilities – both for the singers and the audience. Listen, breathe, and enjoy.  © Concordia UniversityConcordia University
