They are designed to fit within the structure of a degree so as not to extend program length (i.e. Business minors take the place of 12 elective credits within a degree program). Minors are not compulsory and do not replace completing a major.

Business students may choose to pursue a Business minor or a non-business minor (see below). A Business minor consists of 12 credits (4 courses) and may be selected from one of the 13 listed below. Business minors are not open to non-business students.Non-business students may consider the following options, however.Please note that business students may change minors, provided that they have completed at least 12 credits at Concordia and are in good academic standing. To change minors, simply fill in a Change of Concentration form and submit it to MB 4.201.

Alternatively, business students may choose to follow business courses outside of their major without having the minor. Learn more about business electives.ACCO 330
