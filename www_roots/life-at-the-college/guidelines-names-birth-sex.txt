http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/registrar/guidelines-names-birth-sex.htmlTo ensure that:Comments:Where there is variation among documents in the spelling or use of names, date of birth, or sex, the acceptable document which has the most recent date will be used.If the above information is not available, then the name, date of birth and sex on the application is to be compared with documents such as transcripts and Concordia will record the data that appears most frequently. When the study permit is available then the name, date of birth and sex on the Student Information System will be revised to conform to the Study Permit.Students may use one or more of their given names. If more than one name is used they must respect the order in which they appear on official documents.  Comments:As International Students do not normally have a study permit when they apply, an alternate document must be used until the student presents the official study permit. If the student submits a passport, then the birth date on the passport may be used until the study permit has been submitted.On the IMM 5292, the IMM 1000 and the Study Permit from Immigration Canada, the date of birth sometimes reads as */*/1957, for example. The Ministry considers this to be 01/01/1957 and it should be recorded as such rather than as what appears on application form, even if another document is available that shows the day and month of birth.The sex should be recorded as it appears on the official document.If information appearing on official documents is incorrect, it is the responsibility of the student to make arrangements with the authorities issuing the original documents to make the appropriate changes and issue official corrected information.Until corrected official documents are received from the student, information on the Student Information System related to name, date of birth or sex may not be changed.If incorrect information appears on documents issued by Immigration Canada, the student may find the necessary forms and procedures to request an official change on the Government of Canada web site.Comments:© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGuidelines for the acceptable use of names, date of birth and sexI — Principles
