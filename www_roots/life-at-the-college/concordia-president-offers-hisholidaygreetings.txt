http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2013/12/11/concordia-president-offers-hisholidaygreetings.htmlFrançais2013 has been a great year for Concordia. Whether you study, teach or work here, I want to thank you for contributing your ideas and energy every day to make Concordia the vibrant community it is.I am pleased to see we have moved ahead with many of our collective bargaining agreements. This is important for our community.One challenge that remains for the university is Quebec’s Charter of Values (Bill 60), which has generated widespread discontent among our community. I would like to thank the many of you who shared your opinions this fall. You  are helping the university to formulate a response consistent with our diversity and values. This response will be released next week. We will also have the opportunity to express our position to the Government of Quebec in January.Concordia’s great strength is the pride and dedication of Concordians. I wish you all the best for the holidays and the new year.Alan Shepard
