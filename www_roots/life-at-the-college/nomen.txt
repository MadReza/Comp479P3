http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/nomen.htmlStudents may choose to graduate with degree titles that are gender neutral and refer to the diplomas themselves (Baccalaureate, Magisteriate, and Doctorate) or with the traditional nomenclature (Bachelor, Master, and Doctor).

Graduates who have previously been awarded a Concordia degree with the traditional nomenclature may request that their degree be re-issued in the gender neutral nomenclature.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGender Neutral Degree NomenclatureConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
