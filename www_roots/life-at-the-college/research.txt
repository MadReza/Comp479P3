Involving community members at every step of the way, community-based research seeks to address real world problems while creating and reinforcing the habits of participatory citizenship.Each year the Engaged Scholar Awards recognize one student, one faculty member and one community partner for their exemplary participation in community-engaged scholarship. To find researchers who are particularly invested in community-based research, visit Explore Concordia. The following research initiatives pride themselves on being deeply rooted in community:
 Find a complete list of university-recognized research units at Concordia University, which may include other researchers involved in community-based projects.A student-run initiative, the Community-University Research Exchange (CURE) facilitates research collaborations between grassroots community groups and university students. Community groups can make research requests, and students can undertake that research, often for class credit.Co-presented by QPIRG Concordia and QPIRG McGill, Study in Action is an annual undergraduate and community conference. Each year, students, community organizers, and artists are invited to present their contributions to social and environmental justice research.Concordia Community Engagement514-848-2424 ext. 4803communityengagement @concordia.caOffice of Community Engagement© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityResearching with the communityResearch institutes and projectsStudent-led community research initiativesExplore moreStay in touchContact usCommunity University Research Exchange (CURE)Study in ActionConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424Study resourcesCalendar - GraduateCalendar - UndergraduateClass schedulesClass cancellationsCourse registrationImportant academic datesMore academic resourcesCampus servicesConcordia storesIT servicesJob opportunitiesSecurityShuttle busStudent Service Centre (Birks)All campus servicesWhat's newCalendar of eventsLatest newsMedia RelationsFaculties, Schools & CollegesArts and ScienceEngineering and Computer ScienceFine ArtsJohn Molson School of BusinessSchool of Graduate StudiesAll Schools, Colleges & DepartmentsStudy resources
