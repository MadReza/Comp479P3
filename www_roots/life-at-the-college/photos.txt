http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/graduation-convocation/students/photos.htmlYour convocation gown — the hood showing the colours associated with your degree — is the academic dress you wear during the ceremony. All participants, including faculty on stage, wear academic regalia. Be sure to pick up your gown, marshalling card, and have your photo taken.    An official photographer will be present at gown distribution to take your photo. This is a perfect opportunity to have your portrait taken in your regalia. They will take time to take solo or group photos with family or friends as well.  The Concordia University Alumni Association arranges for GradImages to take photos at the Convocation ceremonies as well.GradImages will contact you within two weeks after convocation. They will present you with the sample proofs that you can pick and choose, and an order form.
 Ceremony dates and times are subject to change without notice. Please note that Concordia may tape, film, webcast or broadcast the ceremony.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGraduation photosGraduation & convocation
