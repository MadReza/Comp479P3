Students in the Class of 2014 are asked to give $20.14, in honour of their graduation year!Past classes have created a variety of different awards: either scholarships, which reward outstanding academic achievement, or bursaries, which help students in financial need.This year the Grad Class Committee has chosen to establish a bursary for a full-time, undergraduate student in any program or faculty. The bursary will be open to students who are currently enrolled in a degree program, and will not be renewable – every year, a different student will benefit.We are seeking $30,000 because we want to endow the bursary — in other words, invest the funds in an account that generates income. This income becomes the bursary, which will be awarded every year from now on. If we reach our goal, the bursary will be worth at least $800 every year.Please help us and give today – your gift will keep giving forever!We are the Grad Class Committee: Celia Mechentel, Erin Hynes, Akshit Dutt, Raissa Uwizeye, Sangam Dillon and Faisal Agha. We are all graduating this year and have experience in fundraising. We know the difference a gift can make in the life of a student and we know the power of our support when we all give together.Questions?
