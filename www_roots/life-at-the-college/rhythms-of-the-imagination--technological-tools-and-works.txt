(metro Guy/Concordia)As part of the events surrounding Molior’s 15th founding anniversary, Marie Perrault called upon a selection of artists previously featured by the organization to put together an exhibition that explores the development and appropriation of digital tools. At first filled with promise, the use of technology by artists is nowadays well established. Both the current context and Molior’s anniversary offer a ripe opportunity to look back at these
practices.In accordance with Molior’s mandate since its foundation, the selection focuses on works in which technology contributes to the sensorial experience of viewers, all the while allowing them to decode a world that is increasingly modulated by technological developments. The works gathered provide a glimpse of the wide variety of practices supported by Molior up until now. They mark different periods in the development of the organization, and a majority of them were shown as part of events produced by Molior all around the world. At this turning point, both in the evolution of digital art and the history of Molior, it is important to assess the situation and prepare for the future.Through the exhibition and acquisition history of the selected works, the show will also provide concrete examples to stimulate discussion during the colloquium Contemporary Digital Art, Conservation, Dissemination and the Market Access that will be held shortly after the exhibition.

Artists: Ingrid Bachmann, Luc Courchesne, Jean Dubois, Jean-Pierre Gauthier, Diane Landry, David Rokeby

Molior would like to thank the Canada Council for the Arts, and the Fondation Langlois as well as its partners, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Hexagram, Concordia and the Goethe-Institut for their support of the event.
