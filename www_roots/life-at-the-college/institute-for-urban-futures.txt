The Urban Futures platform brings together various Concordia faculty and graduate students whose research and practice are tethered to the field of urbanism and urbanity (writ large), and themes such as sustainability (arts, design, and culture being the driving force in this area), the right to the city, resilience, reconciliation, migration and urban transformation, environmental humanism, and more.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
