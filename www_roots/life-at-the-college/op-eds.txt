Irvine says much depends on the eventual price differential between legal and illegal marijuana and whether a significant proportion of consumers would stick to illegal pot. A lower legal marijuana market share, he reasons, would result in lower tax revenues. The Gazette piece was reprised in more than a dozen other newspapers.   © Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityOp-edsNews
