We firmly believe that developing talent is a key for communities to prosper and keep pace with our changing economy,” says Karen Leggett, BComm 90, National Bank’s executive vice-president of Marketing and Corporate Strategy. “Our donation to Concordia’s John Molson School of Business is yet one more way for us to tangibly support the next generation of entrepreneurs.”Family businesses in Canada
Family businesses tend to promote strong values and cultures. Yet almost half of Canada’s family enterprises expect to see an intergenerational transfer of ownership by 2017, according to a recent study by the Canadian Association of Family Enterprise. Family businesses are often distinguished by their entrepreneurial cultures and above-average market performances, which make them exceptional targets for research.Steve Harvey, dean of Concordia’s John Molson School of Business, says: “This important investment at JMSB gives our students access to superior learning tools, support systems and knowledgeable professionals whose shared experience truly reflects family enterprise in Canada.”About National Bank
