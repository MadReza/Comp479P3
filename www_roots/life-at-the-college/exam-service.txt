http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/accessibility/exam-service.htmlThis section is designed to help you go through the process of booking an exam using the portal. It is important to understand that a successful booking is only the first step in a set of complicated logistical procedures that the ACSD Exam Coordinator has to complete in a very short period of time for well over two thousand midterms and an equal amount of final exams. Because of this, it is imperative that you make every effort to book your exams as soon as your Professor has notified you that there is to be an exam. In order for you to write Final exams, Supplemental Final exams or Deferred Final Exams with accommodations, you must make your request using your portal (instructions are below) on or before the following date:Fall Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: November 5thWinter Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: March 7thSummer 1 Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: May 27thSummer 2 Term: Final, Supplemental and Deferred exams deadline: July 20thBooking an eConcordia exam?

All Concordia students are expected to follow the procedures and meet the deadline dates as established by the Examinations Office. The ACSD Advisors are there to assist you should you have questions or concerns regarding the reporting of exam conflicts, medical notations, deferred exams, etc.Students who require the use of adaptive or assistive technology during an exam must first meet with the ACSD Technology Specialist in order to be trained on the use of the software during an examination situation as well as understand how to apply to use the technology during an exam.Have further questions after reviewing the above information?
