http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/mission.htmlConcordia University is welcoming, engaged, and committed to innovation and excellence in education, research, creative activity and community partnerships. It dares to be different and draws on its diversity to transform the individual, strengthen society and enrich the world.Concordia’s vision is to rank among Canada’s top five comprehensive universities within the next decade, and to be a first choice for students and faculty locally, across Canada, and internationally in a wide variety of defined areas of research and study.Concordia’s core values stem from those long prized by its founding institutions. Concordia has adopted the motto of the city of Montreal, Concordia salus, which speaks to well-being through harmony. The union of two very different institutions of higher education has led to an exceptionally successful synthesis of compatible and timely values.Excellence
 Concordia values the curiosity and engagement of its faculty, staff, and students. Curiosity about the world around us, respectful engagement with those who inhabit it, and strong determination to improve it lead to productive exploration of current understandings, a rich spectrum of creative activity and practice, and the creation and dissemination of new knowledge.Opportunity
 Concordia values the openness and respect necessary to provide opportunities to a highly diverse student and faculty population. Diversity at Concordia is interpreted broadly: for example, in addition to embracing diversity in ethnicity, gender, language, and accessibility, Concordia provides students with different and original ways of exploring their interests. Enabling faculty, staff and students to make a progressive impact on their world in ways that respect and engage the uniqueness of each individual is a hallmark of Concordia.Quality of Life
 Concordia values a secure and respectful learning environment and workplace. Concordia is committed to promoting a healthy, safe and sustainable campus and to enhancing the quality of life of the community in which we live.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityMission, vision, valuesConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424Mission
