IIF’s initiates, supports and sustains multidisciplinary research-creation that asks: what futures do we want to imagine, and then create, for our Indigenous communities? The project employs a research-creation approach in order to connect Indigenous youth to their heritage, provide them with the skills to be successful creators now, and enable them to imagine how they and their communities will look in the future.IIF supports four major components. The Skins Workshops integrate storytelling from Indigenous communities with technical instruction in digital media production to teach youth how to use emerging forms of communication to tell their own stories. The Residencies host artists, scholars, and community members at the Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology, where they leverage the facilities, faculties and students to think, write, and create work that investigates and illuminates the Indigenous future imaginary from their own disciplinary or interdisciplinary standpoint. The Symposia bring together the members of the nation-wide team to share research findings, as well as invite in guest presenters to talk about similar work elsewhere. The Archive documents Indigenous artists who use new media technology in their practice. The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
