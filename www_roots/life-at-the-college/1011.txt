The core objective is to identify how social and cognitive factors converge in ways that influence the degree to which learners benefit from interacting with peers and more proficient speakers. In terms of social factors, during face-to-face communication interlocutors initiate and respond to joint attention using eye gaze and gestures. Gestures have been shown to facilitate the learning of sound contrasts and words, and this research program explores whether eye gaze also helps L2 learners benefit from interacting with other speakers. Using eye-tracking technology, empirical studies investigate the social conditions under which interlocutors co-construct joint attention, and how joint attention helps L2 speakers benefit cognitively from interactional feedback, linguistic convergence, and attention to linguistic form during face-to-face communication. The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
