http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/kenneth-woods-portfolio/mentors.htmlKWPMP mentors are Montreal and Toronto-area investment professionals who volunteer their time to meet with one or two of our students on a monthly basis. Together, they review developments in the industries and companies that they are responsible for in the KWPMP portfolio and discuss the students’ future career options.
Throughout the program, each KWPMP student is assigned three different mentors, based on the student's area of interest and their investment responsibilities. Our students benefit tremendously from studying each of their mentors' unique approach to investment analysis.We thank the following mentors for volunteering their time and expertise:David Abramson
