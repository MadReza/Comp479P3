http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/volunteering.htmlConcordia's LIVE Centre is your one-stop shop for information about volunteerism. We are a liaison service, linking you to community organizations, student groups and departments seeking to recruit volunteers.Many Concordia students enrich their university experience by volunteering. Volunteering allows you to support a cause you care about and gain valuable experience. Volunteer Ambassadors at the LIVE Volunteer Resource Centre can help you navigate through hundreds of volunteer opportunities on-campus, off-campus and abroad and help you find the one that's right for you!
 Volunteering can be a great career move no matter what your field of study! Register for one of our upcoming workshops (Launch Your Career, Volunteer! or Strategic Volunteering) to find out why and how you can get started. Or, check out the organizations that were here for this year's volunteer fair. Each year, the LIVE Centre presents Volunteer Recognition Awards to Concordia students, staff and faculty who have made a significant contribution as volunteers for the benefit of the Concordia, Montreal or global community.
