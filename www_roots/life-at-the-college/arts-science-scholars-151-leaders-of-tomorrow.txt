Hard work, commitment to excellence and a few sleepless nights — these are just some of the ingredients necessary to be an Arts and Science Scholar.On October 5, a group of 151 of the best and brightest students from the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) were recognized for their exemplary academic achievements.Concordia's Graham Carr, provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, and André Roy, dean of FAS, were among those celebrating the students.The cohort includes those whose grades are in the top one per cent of their respective programs. This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” Three of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.Bachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics
