http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/about/deans-office.htmlWelcome to Concordia University's Faculty of Arts and Science!With a new year upon us, it is the perfect moment to assess the goals our Faculty will pursue over the next 12 months.Now is time to look at how our Faculty can develop and implement its own strategic directions, within the broader context of the university’s overall strategic vision. That means all of us will engage in many fruitful and stimulating discussions and actions that will define the 2025 Faculty of Arts and Science.Above all, we will be exploring our strength and richness as a Faculty that excels in interdisciplinary research. In that spirit, we will work at removing barriers between our programs and Departments and at opening up conversations across our sectors. We can reimagine the way we hire, the way we teach, and the way our students learn.One initiative to open up these conversations is a new series of events, which we will launch on February 10. Beyond Disciplines will highlight interdisciplinary research throughout Concordia’s Faculty of Arts and Science.These events are intended to encourage exchanges and discussion on the major questions of the day, from a variety of viewpoints. This will demonstrate the power of the FAS in shedding new light on issues that matter to society. I hope to see many staff, students and faculty there!And in the spirit of open conversation, I wish to remind you all that you can contact us at any time with ideas and questions you may have.I wish you all great success in your endeavors as the semester continues. This academic year has gotten off to a great start, let us keep going! – André Roy For information on the following offices,
