http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/about/principal.htmlMy educational research involves a full-blown testing of a student-centered approach based on journal writing and in-class use of small collaborative group methods that have been developed in which we incorporate variables measuring a) the instructional context, b) student motivational, cognitive and affective behaviour, and c) meaningful learning.A recent undergraduate student of Dr. Kalman, who had been accustomed to getting A's in all of his courses, wrote to Dr. Kalman just after graduating to say that he would remember the last course he took with him in his final semester at Concordia not only for the course content, but as "a course that taught me how to think".Read Dr. Kalman's faculty profileScience College:
