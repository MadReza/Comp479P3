Such adverse events can affect the brain in many ways, including alterations in neurotransmission, brain structure, endocrinology, among others, all of which may interact. One of our overarching research themes is to examine how early stress, in combination with genetic factors, could affect human brain development and function, epigenetic processes and risk for psychopathology in humans. The postdoctoral fellow will work on a neuro-imaging project investigating the impact of early adversity on human brain processes and associated epigenetic mechanisms. The fellow has also the opportunity to work with existing behavioral, neuro-imaging and/or genetic data that have already been collected in well-documented longitudinal cohort samples. The fellow will work in a highly multidisciplinary team and with several (neuro) scientists based at Concordia University and at other collaborative universities in Montreal.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
