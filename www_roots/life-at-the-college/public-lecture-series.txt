http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/news/public-lecture-series.htmlWe have at least two Public Lectures a year, inviting prominent scientists to give a lecture for the scientifically interested public. We attract usually between 300 and 500 people. After the lecture there is also an opportunity for audience members to meet the speaker on the premises of the Science College at a reception organized by the students. The audience consists of students, academics and mainly interested members of the public.A SINGULARLY UNFEMININE PROFESSION: ONE WOMAN’S JOURNEY IN PHYSICSBY MARY K. GAILLARDMary K. Gaillard will recount some of her experiences as a woman in a male-dominated field. She was unprepared for the various difficulties she encountered at Columbia University, in Paris and at the particle physics laboratory CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland before joining the Berkley Physics faculty as its first woman member. She will describe in depth the physics developments that she witnessed and participated in dynamic period of its inception, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These developments led to the Standard Model of particle Physics. The Standard Model has been confirmed by experiments, culminating in the discovery of the Higgs particle physics in 2012.She will give some vivid reflections on the current status of women in physics today and most importantly on the future of the field.The Science College is part of Concordia University.  It offers gifted science undergraduates the opportunity to complement their regular curriculum with interdisciplinary training and early introduction to the methods of scientific research.October 20, 2016, 8 p.m. – 10 p.m.
