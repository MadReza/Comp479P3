Circadian rhythms in clock protein expression are found in many brain regions outside of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock in mammals. Recent evidence from our laboratory has identified the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) as a key modulator of the expression of the core clock protein, PER2, in the striatum and other forebrain structures important in motivation, emotion regulation, and motor control. The goal of the proposed research is to characterize the role of DA in the regulation of PER2 rhythms by motivational state variables, and to explore the hypothesis that PER2 plays a role in mediating the effects of DA on behavior. The results of these studies will provide basic information on the role DA in the control of clock protein expression in the forebrain and could suggest a novel way to explain how different normal and pathological conditions that lead to changes in DA activity could result in adaptive or maladaptive changes in clock gene oscillations in the forebrain. This, in turn, could have implications for understanding the adaptive nature of the circadian systems as well as the circadian irregularities in disorders such as drug addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and depression. The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
