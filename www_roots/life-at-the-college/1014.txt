Finding clinical strategies to improve cerebral health depends on our ability to measure the impact of CVD on the brain and the changes that follow interventions. We currently lack crucial information about the intermediate steps of the disease process, where prevention interventions can be effective. This project will use recent developments in quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to measure vascular, metabolic and microstructural brain health, to understand how brain health is affected by CVD at this intermediate stage of the disease process.Three groups of older adults will be studied: a CVD group, a high-risk (HR) group and a healthy control (HC) group. Participants will undergo a cardiorespiratory fitness test, a neuropsychological battery and analysis of plasma markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. A quantitative 3T MRI exam will be used to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and white matter integrity via the g-ratio - an index of myelinated thickness.By using physiologically-relevant imaging protocols for measurement of cerebral health, this research will give us a key tool and essential information for understanding and leveraging cerebral plasticity.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
