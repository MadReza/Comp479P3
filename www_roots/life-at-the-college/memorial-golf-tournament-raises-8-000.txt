The 2016 edition of Concordia’s Memorial Golf Tournament, held on August 13, raised $8,000 for student bursaries.In total, 178 Concordia students, staff, faculty, alumni and friends took part in the annual event, which pays tribute to four professors involved in the tragic event of 1992.The players split into foursomes to play the 18-hole course at the Hemmingford Golf Club, using a friendly best-ball format.The women’s foursome of Donna Stewart, Lynn Roy, Cindy Parkinson and Kathy Kennedy came in first, while the team of  Putsky Rice, James Lazare, Jamie Ranch and Josh Mayo claimed the men’s first prize.
 
In the mixed-team category Linda Lavigne, Alain Cote, Bernie Croce and Diane Billaudeau topped the podium.Several Stingers student athletes took part in the tournament, including: quarterback Trenton Miller, who earned the Jess Russel Memorial Trophy as the most outstanding player in the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ) last season; Olivier Hinse, captain of the men’s hockey team; Rowan Power from the men’s basketball team and his coach, Rastko Popovic; and women’s basketball coach Tenicha Gittens.At this year’s edition of the tournament, the Concordia University Part-time Faculty Association (CUPFA) sponsored two “closest to the pin” contests out on the course.
