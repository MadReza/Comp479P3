http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/alumni-friends/giving-to-concordia/planned-giving/faq.htmlWe can help—from explaining your options and how to capitalize on opportunities available under tax laws to making the arrangements and handling the paperwork.Making a gift through a will or life-insurance policy, is only part of the story. Planned giving is for the living.There are many options, in which funds are transferred during the donor’s lifetime, resulting in immediate tax savings to the donor.Think about your charitable giving as part of your financial or estate plan. Planned giving offers you a chance to perpetuate your values and commitment to higher education.You may designate your planned gift to any area of the university, such as a particular faculty, athletic program, or scholarship. You may also choose to endow your gift.An endowment is a gift, made in your lifetime or bequeathed in your will, which provides a never-ending source of income to Concordia University. It differs from other types of contributions in that it remains actively invested, allowing the university to draw on it in perpetuity. Financial support is drawn from the income generated by the initial donation and allocated according to the donor’s specifications. The principal remains untouched.Each endowment carries the name of the person or persons for whom it is established. An endowment is a very special and meaningful way to create a permanent remembrance for a loved one, or ensure that your own long-term philanthropic goals will be fulfilled. Funds are used solely for the purpose designated. Yes! First of all, make sure that Concordia is aware of your bequest. If you have made—or plan to make—a bequest to the university in your will, we invite you to become a member of the Concordia Heritage Society, which has been established to recognize you and promote the importance of planned gifts. As a Planned Giving donor, you join an exclusive club called the Concordia Heritage Society.Established to underscore the importance of planned gifts to the university and recognize the generosity of donors, the Concordia Heritage Society hosts periodic gatherings for supporters of higher education.View photos and listen to the podcast of our 2015 event.
An understanding of tax laws and how they relate to different asset categories makes it possible to allocate funds to provide for your family and—by significantly reducing your tax burden through a charitable donation—leave room for a meaningful gift to Concordia at relatively little net cost.Speak to your financial advisor or call us at Concordia.
