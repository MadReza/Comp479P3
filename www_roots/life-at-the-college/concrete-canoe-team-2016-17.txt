Engineering students from all over the country converge to race canoes they design and build — entirely out of concrete!With your help, we will: How it worksThe task is to build a 20-foot canoe — made entirely out of concrete — that's light enough to float yet strong enough to carry four paddlers. After we design and assemble the canoe in accordance with competition rules, we'll race it against canoes from more than a dozen other Canadian universities.Our strong and dedicated team relies on support from donors to help cover expenses: materials (cement, aggregate, additives), equipment, travel, advertising and competition fees.Last year — our first time ever at the competition — we placed eighth out of 14. Building on last year's experience, and with your support, we believe we can build the fastest, most innovative canoe. Help us bring home the gold!Questions?
