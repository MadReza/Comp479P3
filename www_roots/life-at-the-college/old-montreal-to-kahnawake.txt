The goal is to learn about oneself and physically experience the distance that separates two cultures — and to build bridges over those gaps.In 2014, we led our Theological Studies and Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability students on the same pilgrimagee. It was such a rich experience that we want to offer this special opportunity to others.Our expensesFunds raised will subsidize:We areMatthew Anderson and Sara Terreault, part-time faculty at Concordia's Department of Theological Studies. Matthew also teaches at the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability and Sara at the School of Canadian Irish Studies.We have been engaged in research in pilgrimage studies for several years. We are currently editing a volume titled "The Pilgrim Body: An Anatomy of Christian and Post-Christian Intentional Movement" for Ashgate Publishing UK. Matthew has produced two documentaries about pilgrimage and mixed identities. (Watch the trailer for Something Grand.)
