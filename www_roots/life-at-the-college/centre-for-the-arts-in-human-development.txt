Email fundone@concordia.ca.This Centre for the Arts in Human Development (CAHD) seeks to mount a theatrical review of past productions, including the popular The Frog and the Princess.  Such a production incurs expenses for sound production, lighting, rental of theatre space and more, so the team hopes to raise the funds needed through the generous support of donors like you. Developing and mounting theatrical productions is a long-standing tradition of the program. Casts are formed from the client base of the CAHD therapeutic program and aided by Concordia students in the Creative Arts Therapies. On occasion students in performing arts programs have also contributed — for example in actor coaching to set design — as part of independent study courses.Original scripts and music are written and composed through a collaboration between long-time director Stephen Snow, composer Shelley Snow and centre participants. Shows are produced by centre's director, Lenore Vosberg.Productions explore challenges faced by those living with special needs, including developing confidence, discovering inner strength and changing attitudes toward people with disibilities.Through specialized performances called ethnodramas, participants learn to express themselves in their own words and tell their own stories. Family and friends consistently observe that participants go on to apply these social skills elsewhere, enjoying an improved quality of life.The CAHD performs four primary functions: Our directors © Concordia UniversityAdvancement & Alumni Relations, 514-848-2424, ext. 4856Concordia UniversityCentre for the Arts in Human DevelopmentAlumni & friends
