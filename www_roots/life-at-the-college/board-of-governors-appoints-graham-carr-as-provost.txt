I am very pleased to announce that Concordia’s Board of Governors has appointed Graham Carr as provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs. It’s a role he’s held on an interim basis since May 1, along with his regular duties as vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.I’d like to thank Graham for going the extra mile these past few months. Over the years, he’s made tremendous contributions in strengthening and expanding our research program, and attracting top-notch researchers and graduate students. As provost, he will continue to be a collaborative and innovative leader.I’d like to thank the members of the search committee for their hard work and due diligence in selecting Graham for this critical key role. They are Andreas Athienitis, Anne-Marie Croteau, David Douglas, Norman Hébert, Jr., Cody Hyndman, Geoffrey Little, David Walsh, Anne Whitelaw, Terry Wilkings and Andie Zeliger. The search for a vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies will begin shortly, and I’ll update the community once that search committee has been formed.In the meantime, I’ve invited Justin Powlowski to assume this role on an interim basis, and he has accepted. Justin has been associate vice-president of Strategy and Operations in the Office of Research for almost five years. I’d like to thank him for taking on these additional duties.To support Justin and to continue building the momentum we have created for our research program, I’ve invited Lynn Hughes and Ferhat Khendek to join the Office of Research as interim associate vice-presidents. Lynn is an associate professor in the Faculty of Fine Arts and Concordia Research Chair in Interactive Design and Games Innovation. Ferhat, a professor in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and, is the NSERC/Ericsson Senior Industrial Research Chair in Model Based Software Management. I’d also like to thank Lynn and Ferhat for accepting these new responsibilities.Please join me in congratulating Graham on his appointment as provost.Alan Shepard
President
