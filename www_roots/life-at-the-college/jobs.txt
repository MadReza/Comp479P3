Finding clinical strategies to improve cerebral health depends on our ability to measure the impact of CVD on the brain and the changes that follow interventions. We currently lack crucial information about the intermediate steps of the disease process, where prevention interventions can be effective. This project will use recent developments in quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to measure vascular, metabolic and microstructural brain health, to understand how brain health is affected by CVD at this intermediate stage of the disease process.Three groups of older adults will be studied: a CVD group, a high-risk (HR) group and a healthy control (HC) group. Participants will undergo a cardiorespiratory fitness test, a neuropsychological battery and analysis of plasma markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. A quantitative 3T MRI exam will be used to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and white matter integrity via the g-ratio - an index of myelinated thickness.By using physiologically-relevant imaging protocols for measurement of cerebral health, this research will give us a key tool and essential information for understanding and leveraging cerebral plasticity.

                                    Please include the reference number with your application Full job descriptionWe are currently seeking a postdoctoral fellow to join our research team investigating the neural mechanisms of spoken and written word comprehension and speech production in bilinguals. The goal of our research is to characterize the expressive and productive speech and language capabilities of French/English bilinguals, ranging from the relatively low level building blocks of speech and language processing (brainstem responses, frequency following responses, sub-word units) to relatively high levels involving context use, semantics, and speech-in-noise perception.He/she will have a strong interest in the interplay between cognitive science, language, bilingualism and multilingualism, and the ability to work in a team. The ideal candidate will have expertise in bilingual language processing or bilingual cognitive science, with experience with brain imaging techniques including EEG/event-related brain potentials (ERPs).The candidate will be hosted in the Department of Psychology/CRDH, Concordia Universityand will benefit from strong collaborative links within the Centre for Research on Brain.

                                    Please include the reference number with your application Full job descriptionSleep disturbances are highly prevalent and are associated with cognitive complaints as well as alterations in brain areas critical for cognitive processing. Greater insomnia difficulties are also associated with greater risk of later cognitive decline. In addition, biomarkers of neurodegeneration have been found associated with short sleep and altered EEG activity during sleep, suggesting that disturbed sleep may contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.The selected postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to work on a research program that will further examine the relationships between sleep, biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and cognitive performances in various clinical populations, using a multimodal approach (e.g., EEG, neuroimaging). This program will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of sleep in memory and cognitive decline, and will have clinical implications for future therapeutic approaches.The fellow will have access to Concordia’s PERFORM Center, an 8000m2 facility devoted to health prevention that hosts multiple research platforms such as a Sleep Lab and an Imaging Suite (including a 3-Tesla MRI, SPECT-CT and PET-CT), fully dedicated to research. The PERFORM Sleep Lab, led by Dr. Dang-Vu, includes 3 bedrooms equipped with polysomnography and high-density EEG systems, actigraphy devices and cognitive testing equipment.Application Deadline: open until the position is filled no no later than October 31, 2016
