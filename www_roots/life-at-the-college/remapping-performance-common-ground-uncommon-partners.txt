http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/2016/04/05/remapping-performance-common-ground-uncommon-partners.htmlUncommon partnerships between people from performance and other fields -- – community development, environmental remediation, gerontology, etc. -- emerge when neither collaborator’s goals are attainable by their expertise alone. Such projects may or may not include the creation of shows, take place on a stage, direct themselves to established audiences, or be recognizable as performance, but do rely deeply on aesthetic training, methodologies, and mindsets. The context of such work is not art but a social frame. Looked at as a whole, the preponderance of uncommon partners points to a need to remap performance; this phenomenon is not so much new as unintegrated in the map most of us carry of where performance takes place.
