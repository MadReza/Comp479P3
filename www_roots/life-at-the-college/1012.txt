Today we have the capacity to create new metabolic pathways in microbes to make chemicals we find useful but that the microbes do not naturally produce. The Biosensors for Synthetic Biology project will engineer protein-based biosensors with the capacity to detect non-natural small molecules. These biosensor will be deployed to engineer enzymes, control pathways and evolve strains of yeasts. The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
