The Jorisch Family Artist Residency, launched in the presence of Georges Jorisch’s descendants at Concordia on November 21, 2016, will provide support for one graduate student annually to experience life and learning in Salzburg, Austria.Every year, one selected student will complete an artist residency at the Amalie Redlich Tower of the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg.“We are grateful to the Jorisch family for creating this unique opportunity at the Museum der Moderne where our Fine Arts students will benefit from what is sure to be a transformative experience,” says Concordia President Alan Shepard.In memory of his grandmother and to foster increased artist residencies, Georges Jorisch had previously donated money to restore the Amalie Redlich Tower at the Museum der Moderne.As part of his original agreement, he had requested that a Canadian artist take residency at the museum one month of each year.Thanks to his family’s $250,000 gift to Concordia’s Faculty of Fine Arts, Georges Jorisch’s original vision is now a reality. “Concordia made it easy,” says Stéphane Jorisch. “The university has one of the largest and most comprehensive fine arts faculties in Canada — it just made sense to us.”A legacy of continued learningFollowing restitution of Georges Jorisch’s paintings, his main vocation was to ensure his grandchildren and future generations could attend a university of their choice."The Concordia community takes great pride in being selected as custodians of the Jorisch Family Artist Residency program,” says Bram Freedman, Concordia's vice-president of Advancement and External Relations. “We are thankful for this residency that will grant students an opportunity to experiment boldly.”“This generous gift has created an important and lasting bond between our students, the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg and members of the Jorisch family,” says Rebecca Duclos, dean of Concordia’s Faculty of Fine Arts. “The residency illustrates precisely what Concordia feels most strongly about: working in partnership with others to enrich our students’ lives through immersive experiences both here and abroad.”Georges Jorisch’s granddaughter, Édith, followed his quest for the restitution of the final Klimt painting in her documentary, L’héritier, which debuts in fall 2016. Her film chronicles her grandfather’s story — from his Second World War childhood to his lifelong hunt for his family’s missing paintings. “My grandfather never gave up. I will always admire his courage and determination,” she says.Watch the trailer for L'héritier:&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;L'Héritier - Bande-annonce from Edith Jorisch on Vimeo.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keywordHow three stolen masterworks were recoveredSome 20 years ago, amid stalks of tomes in an Old Montreal bookstore, Georges Jorisch uncovered a major clue into his family’s past. An art book cover image featured a rendering of Gustav Klimt’s Church in Cassone — a painting that once belonged to his grandmother, Amalie Redlich.The masterwork hung in his childhood home outside of Vienna, Austria, along with Klimt’s Litzlberg am Attersee and a third painting, Children on Their Way Home From School, by Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller.During the Second World War, the masterpieces were looted when the German Nazis annexed Austria in 1938. With an imminent war, Georges Jorisch escaped from Austria with his father and settled in Belgium. Georges’s mother and grandmother, who insisted on staying behind, were killed in the Holocaust.In 1957, Georges Jorisch moved to Montreal and put his past behind him. He seldom spoke of those painful memories. It wasn’t until seeing a photo of his late grandmother’s painting in that fateful bookstore that he began to consider repatriating his family’s stolen art.Jorisch began writing letters to authorities and assorted connections to reclaim his family’s artworks. As sole heir to his grandmother, Georges Jorisch made it his life’s mission to repatriate his family’s treasures.“Money was never a thing for him,” says Stéphane Jorisch. “It was about getting back what belonged to his family.”His cause was vindicated towards the end of his life. Georges Jorisch repatriated all three family paintings for the benefit of his wife, Eliane, his four children — Jean-Pierre, Stéphane, Natalie and Georges, Jr. — as well as his 10 grandchildren.The two Klimt paintings were sold through auctions. The Waldmüller painting was gifted to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts — an homage to the city that had welcomed him after the war.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityRepatriated Austrian art allows family to pay it forward in CanadaAlumni & friends
