This prestigious program is designed to attract and retain top-tier national and international researchers who have demonstrated the capacity to be leaders in their fields. Seventy Banting fellowships (valued at $70,000 per year for two years) are awarded annually with an equal distribution among CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC. Concordia has experienced real success in previous Banting competitions, with four Banting fellowships awarded in the 2012-2013 competition, and one awarded from each of the 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 competitions. In addition to evaluating the quality of the applicant’s research program and leadership potential, the Banting competition requires that host universities endorse all applications by describing the institutional commitment and supporting environment for the research program, and demonstrate the synergy between the applicant’s research area and the University's strategic priorities.Although the Banting competition is open to Canadians, permanent residents and internationals, there are eligibility restrictions pertaining to the date of the last earned degree. As per the competition guidelines please note, too, that the University will not endorse applications from individuals who received their PhD from Concordia. For further information about eligibility for the Banting fellowships, as well as description of key application elements and institutional responsibilities, please visit the Banting website. Applicants who wish to be hosted by Concordia University must submit a letter of intent (LOI) to the Associate Dean Research and Graduate Studies of the respective Faculty by June 23rd, 2016. *** For the LOI, the following documents will be required:This year's selection process will consist of the following steps:Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the pre-selection process of the Banting competition, please contact Cynthia Raso, Postdoctoral Studies and Graduate Enrolment Officer, by phone at (514) 848-2424, ext. 3385 or by email at cynra@alcor.concordia.ca© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityBanting Postdoctoral FellowshipConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
