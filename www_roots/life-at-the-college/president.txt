Concordia is known for its diversity, accessibility and connections to the community, and for robust academic programs in disciplines such as engineering, business, the humanities and fine and performing arts.We approach societal issues from a broad perspective in preparing our students to become engaged citizens and in giving them the knowledge and skills needed to meet their education goals in a rapidly changing world. Our mission, vision and values are embodied in everything we do, from the development of our academic programs and institutional initiatives to the prudent management of our fiscal resources and sustainable development of our infrastructure. A key priority is to maintain a dialogue with our community, which includes some 46,000 students, 7,100 faculty and staff and 170,000 alumni from across Canada and around the world.I invite you to find out more about Concordia through the public documents accessible through this page and elsewhere on our website.
