Every year, the charm of Montreal, a cosmopolitan blend of Europe and North America, draws more international students than any other city in the world. With a population of over three million people, the city is one of Canada's two largest economic centres and is located just a short distance from several other major Eastern North American cities. Montreal offers an outstanding quality of life and is an ideal location for earning a PhD.Attend an information sessionContact usDownload program brochure© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityProgram advantagesJohn Molson School of Business
