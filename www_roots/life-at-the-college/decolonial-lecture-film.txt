Although the blockade is often dismissed as the “native unrest” of peoples who cannot let go of history, it is quite the opposite.  This talk will argue that the blockade is one of the clearest articulations of the contemporary problem of settler colonialism.  With SHIRI PASTERNAK who has worked in solidarity with the people of Barriere Lake since 2008.Feb. 26 | 10:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. | H-1269Film and Discussion: "Honour Your Word"HONOUR YOUR WORD (2013) is a portrait of life behind the barricades for the Algonquins of Barriere Lake, a First Nation whose dignity and courage contrast sharply with the political injustice they face. After the film there will be a discussion facilitated by Dr. Shiri Pasternak who has worked in solidarity with the people of Barriere Lake since 2008. The event will provide an opportunity to reflect on the colonial present in Canada as well as present day anti-colonial struggle.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
