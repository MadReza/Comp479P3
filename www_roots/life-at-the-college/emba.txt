To apply for the exemption or for further information please speak with the Assistant Director of the EMBA.In order to register, a student's account must be in "good standing" (i.e. the student has no outstanding balance or monies owing from a previous or current term). Once a student has registered for a course(s) or course notation, e.g. CIP, STOQ, the student becomes responsible for payment of the resulting fees. Fees become due at the start of the fall term.For the purpose of this document, the definition of the words "payment" and "paid" is:"A student's account is considered to have been paid only when the student's payment appears on the student's account."The student's payment must appear on the student's account no later than the published payment deadline date. If the student makes a payment at his/her bank or on the bank's online payment service, and if that payment is made on the actual payment deadline date, or one or two days before the payment deadline date, the payment will not appear on the student's account until after the deadline, and the late payment penalties may apply.All monies owing to the University (such as tuition and compulsory fees, library fines, etc.) must be paid when they become due; that is, the payment must appear on the student's account no later than the payment deadline date.A Student's Account balance is available on the student portal (under the MyConcordia Menu » Student Accounts Services » Student's Account).

Other payment methods may also take several days to appear on the student's account. Please keep this mind when meeting a payment deadline.The University will not accept cash or credit cards for the payment of student tuition and compulsory fees. Payments can be made byNote:
Canadian banks limit the "daily" amount that can be withdrawn with a debit (Interac) card even if the monies are available in the student's bank account. Before going to the Birks Student Service Centre to pay a large sum by debit card, students are asked to contact their bank to advise them that a large payment will be made. The bank should also be advised of the amount of the payment. Your bank will temporarily lift the "per day" limit, and your payment will be processed by Concordia without undue delays.In exceptional circumstances that are beyond the student's control, students with an outstanding (overdue) balance from a previous term may be eligible to negotiate a payment arrangement with the Student Accounts Office. A payment arrangement would allow the student to register for courses.If the student does not meet the terms and conditions of the Special Payment Agreement contract, the student will not be eligible to negotiate a payment arrangement for one full academic year, i.e. the next 3 to 5 academic terms.Note: 
Payment arrangements do not supersede the University's financial regulations with regard to the release of diplomas, scholastic certificates, official and unofficial transcripts of academic record, attending convocation plus letters of attestation of academic standing, confirmation of enrolment, confirmation of grades or completion of program, financial standing, immigration status, degree verification, detailed statements of account, payment receipts or permission to register in future terms. In addition, students will not be permitted to register for additional courses or future academic terms until all current amounts due are paid in full. 

The University reserves the right to cancel a current registration if payment arrangements are not honoured. However, current registrations will not automatically be cancelled for non-payment of an outstanding balance.Miscellaneous fees (e.g. interest charges, locker fees, fines, etc.) are due 30 days from the date that the charge is posted to the student's account. After that date, late payment and interest fees are applied to accounts with an outstanding balance.All accounts are subject to revision for changes to the published scale of fees (which may be made without prior notice at or before the beginning of an academic term), registrations of record and for the adjustment of errors or omissions, as well as in the case of courses cancelled by the University.Tuition & Enrolment (tax) receipts are issued each February for the previous taxation year and are available to students on their student portal (www.MyConcordia.ca).Current and/or future registrations may be cancelled if a cheque or credit card payment (e.g. application fee) is returned for any reason.
