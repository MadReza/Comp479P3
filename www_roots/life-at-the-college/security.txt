http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/graduate/phd/students/security.htmlMSc students have access to the MB building 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In order to curtail unauthorized entries into the MB building after hours and to reduce the risk of personal security, theft and/or property damage, the following procedures for “after hours” (between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Monday to Friday) and weekend entry are in effect.

All entries and exits after hours and on weekends are to be effected through the main building entrance (1450 Guy street). If you wish to enter the building and the door is locked, wait for the building security agent to arrive.

Faculty, staff, and graduate students must present a VALID Concordia ID card to the MB building security agent upon request and sign the security log-book.

Please note that during the “after hours” period, you may have to wait a few minutes for the building security agent to arrive since, periodically, the agent will be patrolling the building and therefore will be away from the security desk.

If at any time you have security issues while in the building please leave the area immediately, then contact the Security office in room H-116, telephone number 514-848-2424, extension 5356 and notify the MSc/PhD program office as soon as possible. If the security agent is not at the security desk, please contact 514-848-3717 or internal phones 3717.
