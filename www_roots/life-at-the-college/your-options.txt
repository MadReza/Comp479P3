http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/alumni-friends/giving-to-concordia/planned-giving/your-options.htmlWe can tailor any planned gift around you and your family’s progression, your life stage and your financial situation.The most common type of planned gift is a bequest, but there are many giving vehicles.Capital gains taxes on shares, bonds or mutual funds are eliminated upon donation to the university.This long-term component in executive compensation is focused on performance over more than three years. In today’s volatile economy and job market, executives may be wise to exercise their options while they are in an upswing and make a difference to Concordia with a minimal impact on their cash flow.Not to be overlooked, this is a mid-term component of executive compensation that executives can consider donating. While all income received under this form of executive compensation is tax-deferred until eventually paid out, all is taxed at full employment income rates upon receipt. Timing a significant planned gift to Concordia following payment is a wise decision.In return for a donation of fixed-income investments, the donor receives guaranteed payments for life, a large portion of which is tax-free, and a tax receipt for 20 per cent – 30 per cent of the capital donated. A gift plus annuity is most appropriate for donors aged 68 and up.A principal residence, vacation home or artwork is transferred to the university, while the right to use and enjoy is retained by the donor for life.Most appropriate for donors aged 70 and over, a charitable remainder trust is an irrevocable transfer to a trust, either during the donor’s lifetime or through a will. Usually the trust pays an income to the designated beneficiaries during their lifetime and the remainder is then transferred to the university.Name Concordia as owner and irrevocable beneficiary of your policy. This type of gift is appropriate for donors aged 30 to 60 who hold an existing policy that is no longer needed, or who want to make a large gift but have limited resources.A bequest is a gift promised in a will that can reduce estate taxes. Bequests may consist of a variety of asset types: registered funds, pension plan accumulation, RRSPs or RRIFs.  Principal Director, Planned Giving
