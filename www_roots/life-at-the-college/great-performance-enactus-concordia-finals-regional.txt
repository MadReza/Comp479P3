Twenty-three teams participated in the event, which is a competition focused on entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and sustainability.  Teams were judged on the impact that the social entrepreneurship projects that they conceived and implemented had on the communities where the initiatives took place.

The Enactus Concordia team’s performance earned it its best-ever result, finishing as runner up in two categories: the Capital One Financial Education Challenge and in the Scotiabank EcoLiving Green Challenge. The team earned the second runner-up place in the TD Entrepreneurship Challenge. This is the first time that Enactus Concordia placed in all three categories at the Regional Exposition.

Organized by Concordia’s Entrepreneurship and Management Association (CEMA), the Enactus Concordia team was made up of Julie Marin, Claudia Bertuccini, William Atsaidis, Valérie Sicard, Julia Vo, Christina Cefaratti, Maya Chopova, Julie Provencher, Nickolas Lépine, Yusudan Ren, Esther Peterson, Geneviève Normandin, Adrian Mahon, Tatiana Adzic, Yasmina Soussi, Julian Di Bartolomeo, Emilie Dufort, Jeremy Kovac, Caitlin Lloyd, Lauren Wilson, Janet Kar and Beatrice Ip Yam.  Ron Abraira, a lecturer in the Departmenr of Management, is the team’s faculty advisor. The team’s performance has earned them a spot at the Enactus Canada National Competition to be held in Calgary at the end April.
