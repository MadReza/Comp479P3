http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/international/sessions-workshops/housing-support.htmlThe Concordia Student Union's Off-Campus Housing and Job Bank (HoJo) is a good place to start your apartment search. On HoJo’s site you can find a variety of resources to help you with off-campus apartment hunting, including information on temporary accommodations upon arrival to Montreal. This workshop, facilitated by our student-volunteers and a HOJO representative, gives you a virtual tour of Montreal neighbourhoods and talks about helpful tips on how to find housing near both the downtown SGW campus and the Loyola campus. We will also talk about personal apartment hunting experiences. Volunteers will be on hand for an additional drop-in hour after each workshop to assist with your questions about apartment hunting. We will also have a computer available for you to browse on-line for apartments.You can reach out to HoJo as follows: Visit:Suite H-260
