The Horizon Fellows program is a key component of the Double our Research strategic direction and will bring a fresh cohort of exceptional young researchers who will challenge our faculty, mentor the next generation of researchers, and boost our research and creative productivity. Our Horizon Fellows will work in state-of-the-art facilities and centres with top researchers, while advancing their own development as future research leaders in all sectors.We will fund 25 to 30 two-year fellowships per year in a range of disciplines where supervisors have demonstrated a link to our Strategic Research Plan. A call for applications is released based on projects selected in a highly competitive process.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityHorizon Postdoctoral FellowshipsConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
