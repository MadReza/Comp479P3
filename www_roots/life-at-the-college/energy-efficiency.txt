It includes analysis, design, and control of energy-efficient buildings and HVAC systems, solar energy utilization and intelligent buildings.A fabrication shop provides the necessary resources to prepare special research samples of equipment for use in research. Instrumentation and calibration facilities are also provided, and a two-story prototype laboratory is available to accommodate full-scale assemblies used in research projects.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityEnergy EfficiencyDepartment of Building, Civil & Environmental Engineering (BCEE)
