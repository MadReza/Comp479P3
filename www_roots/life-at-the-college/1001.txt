The objective is to study the recently introduced concept of “weighted Hurwitz numbers”, which are weighted enumerations of branched covers of the Riemann sphere, from a probabilistic viewpoint. This means studying the asymptotics of the partition functions and expectation values of Hurwitz numbers in various limits: semiclassical (small parameter), large genus and for the quantum model closely related to Bose gases, zero temperature and possibly doubly scaled combinations. The purpose will be to compute the leading term asymptotics and lower order corrections, in suitable scaling limits, and search, in the correlations, for possible new forms of “universallity” (i.e. limiting distributions that are independent of the parametric family of deformation in the weightings.) The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
