The goal of our research is to characterize the expressive and productive speech and language capabilities of French/English bilinguals, ranging from the relatively low level building blocks of speech and language processing (brainstem responses, frequency following responses, sub-word units) to relatively high levels involving context use, semantics, and speech-in-noise perception.  He/she will have a strong interest in the interplay between cognitive science, language, bilingualism and multilingualism, and the ability to work in a team. The ideal candidate will have expertise in bilingual language processing or bilingual cognitive science, with experience with brain imaging techniques including EEG/event-related brain potentials (ERPs).The candidate will be hosted in the Department of Psychology/CRDH, Concordia Universityand will benefit from strong collaborative links within the Centre for Research on Brain.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
