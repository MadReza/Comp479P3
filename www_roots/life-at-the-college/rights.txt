http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/rights.htmlUnder the direction of the Director and Senior Advisor, Rights and Responsibilities (the “Advisor”), the Office of Rights and Responsibilities is mandated with administering the Code of Rights and Responsibilities (PDF) (the “Code”) and other related University policies. The Code sets standards of conduct for all University members (students, faculty, and staff).The Code of Rights and Responsibilities (PDF) is intended to promote and protect the values of civility, equity, respect, non-discrimination and an appreciation of diversity as well as support members who have experienced or are experiencing conduct that violates these fundamental values. All members may reasonably expect to pursue their work, studies, and other activities related to University life in a safe and civil environment. As such, members are expected to refrain from violating the Code. The following offences are prohibited under the Code:(For a complete list of infractions and procedures, please consult the Code (PDF)).If you have a problem related to someone’s behaviour on campus and you are not sure how to deal with it, the Office can help you evaluate your options and make an informed choice of what steps to take.You do not have to file a complaint in order to get information or advice. In most cases informal resolution is both possible and desirable. If the situation warrants, the Advisor can guide you on how to proceed with a formal complaint. If it is necessary to file a formal complaint, the Code places great emphasis on fairness and natural justice.You may also get advice for situations that may be happening off campus. Although the University cannot intervene in these situations, the Advisor will try to give you information, advice and support.The full text of the Code can be found in the University calendars and online in English and in French.Faculty & staff news:
