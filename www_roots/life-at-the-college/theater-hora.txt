Disabled Theater sheds light on the dynamics of exclusion that leads to the marginalization of those who are considered as unable to produce.It demonstrates that on the contrary, they are able to question the very mechanisms of representation and hint at existence as a non-partitioned mode of presence.Who we areThe initiative to bring Theater Hora to Concordia is led by members of the Concordia Working Group in Critical Disability Studies (CWGCDS), a group that examines how institutions, cities or societies 'dis-able' people systemically and socially. Members approach the subject from a variety of disciplines, and explore how the body and impairment can be incorporated into critical discussions of disability and disablement.Watch an excerpt of Disabled Theater:&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;FundOne questions?Email fundone@concordia.ca.© Concordia UniversityAdvancement & Alumni Relations, 514-848-2424, ext. 4856Concordia UniversityTheater HoraAlumni & friends
