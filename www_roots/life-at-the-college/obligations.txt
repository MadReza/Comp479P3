http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/admissions/tuition-fees/how-fees-are-billed/other-graduate-programs/obligations.htmlThe University reserves the right to modify the published scale of tuition and other student fees without prior notice. This document contains the most current information on the University's Financial Regulations and Fees and is the authoritative document regarding the University's financial regulations as well as the billing of tuition and compulsory fees.In order to register, a student’s account must be in “good standing” (i.e. the student has no outstanding balance or monies owing from a previous or current term). Once a student has registered for a course(s) or course notation, e.g. CIP, STOQ, the student becomes responsible for payment of the resulting fees. Fees become due at the start of each term and must be paid no later than the published payment deadline date.For the purpose of this document, the definition of the words "payment" and "paid" is:"A student's account is considered to have been paid only when the student's payment appears on the student's account."

The student’s payment must appear on the student’s account no later than the published payment deadline date. If the student makes a payment at his/her bank or on the bank’s online payment service, and if that payment is made on the actual payment deadline date, or one or two days before the payment deadline date, the payment will not appear on the student’s account until after the deadline, and the late payment and interest fees will be charged.All monies owing to the University (such as tuition and compulsory fees, residence rent, delinquent emergency loans, library fines, etc.) must be paid when they become due; that is, the payment must appear on the student's account no later than the payment deadline date.A Student's Account balance is available on the student portal (under the MyConcordia Menu » Financial » Student's Account). Payment deadline dates are available under the Fee Payment Deadlines section and on the Student's Account. No printed invoices or statements of account are issued by the University.Tuition and compulsory fees become due on the first day of class and must be paid in full (appear on the student's account) no later than:Note:
When a payment deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, payments will be accepted until 7 pm on the next business day. Payments received after that time will be subject to a late payment fee and monthly interest charges.Note 1:
No printed invoices or statements of account will be issued by the University. If someone other than the student will be paying the student’s fees, e.g. a parent or spouse, the student must make sure that the person paying the fees is fully aware of the payment deadlines, methods by which payment can be made and the consequences of making a late payment.Note 2:
Payments made through a bank’s online payment service takes approximately 3 to 5 business days to appear on the student’s account. Other payment methods may also take several days to appear on the student’s account. Please keep this mind when meeting a payment deadline.The University will not accept cash or credit cards for the payment of student tuition and compulsory fees. Payments can be made byNote:
Canadian banks limit the "daily" amount that can be withdrawn with a debit (Interac) card even if the monies are available in the student's bank account. Before going to the Birks Student Service Centre to pay a large sum by debit card, students are asked to contact their bank to advise them that a large payment will be made. The bank should also be advised of the amount of the payment. Your bank will temporarily lift the "per day" limit, and your payment will be processed by Concordia without undue delays.In exceptional circumstances that are beyond the student’s control, students with an outstanding (overdue) balance from a previous term may be eligible to negotiate a payment arrangement with the Student Accounts Office.  A payment arrangement would allow the student to register for courses during the regular registration period only, i.e. not during the early registration period.  The Student Accounts Office begins to negotiate payment arrangements two weeks prior to the start of a new academic term and will continue to accept requests until the last day to register for that term.The late payment and interest fees apply to all outstanding balances that are not paid by the published fee payment deadline dates even when a payment arrangement has been negotiated.  The terms and conditions of a Special Payment Agreement contract require the student to make a down-payment of 75% of the outstanding balance from the student’s most recent term of registration plus 100% of older balances will be required before the Accounts Restriction will be lifted.The terms and conditions of the contract require the student to pay the remaining 25% of the outstanding balance from the previous term, plus applicable late payment and interest fees, as follows:All fees for term(s) in which the student is permitted to register (as a result of signing the contract) must be paid by the following dates or registration for future terms will be cancelled:Note
Payment arrangements do not supersede the University’s financial regulations with regard to the release of diplomas, scholastic certificates, official and unofficial transcripts of academic record, attending convocation plus letters of attestation of academic standing, confirmation of enrolment, confirmation of grades or completion of program, financial standing, immigration status, degree verification, detailed statements of account, payment receipts or permission to register in future terms. In addition, students will not be permitted to register for additional courses or future academic terms until all current amounts due are paid in full.The University reserves the right to cancel a current registration if payment arrangements are not honoured. However, current registrations will not automatically be cancelled for non-payment of an outstanding balance.Note
By signing a tuition deferral contract, the student agrees to pay all monies owing to the University at the time of the disbursement of their student aid. The lending agency will automatically deduct the monies owed to the University from the loan or bursary and will forward the monies directly to the University.

Late payment and interest fees will be charged even when the student’s account is paid by a student loan or bursary.All miscellaneous fees (e.g. interest charges, locker fees, fines, etc.) are due immediately. The student has 30 days to pay the fee from the date that the charge becomes due on their account. Late payment and interest fees are applied to accounts with an outstanding balance.All accounts are subject to revision for changes to the published scale of fees (which may be made without prior notice at or before the beginning of an academic term), registrations of record and for the adjustment of errors or omissions, as well as in the case of courses cancelled by the University.Tuition & Enrolment (tax) receipts are issued each February for the previous taxation year and are available to students on their student portal (www.MyConcordia.ca) > My Student Centre > Finances > Account Inquiry > Accounts Services.Please note your tax receipts will only be issued for eligible amounts that have been paid. If you have an outstanding balance from the taxation year, your receipt will not include the unpaid amount.Once you have paid your outstanding balance, if the amount affects your tax receipt, the information will be recalculated bi-weekly.  Current and/or future registrations may be cancelled if a cheque or credit card payment (e.g. application fee) is returned for any reason. A returned items processing fee will be charged for each returned item.If monies owing to the University are not paid when they become due the monies owing will be considered to be overdue and the student's account will be considered to be delinquent.Overdue payments and delinquent accounts are managed as follows:© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFinancial Obligations1.
