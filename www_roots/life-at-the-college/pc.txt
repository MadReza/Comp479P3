http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/maps/buildings/pc.htmlLocated on the south side of Sherbrooke Street at the Loyola campus, the PERFORM Centre makes a striking impression as it inclines towards de Maisonneuve Street. The main floor’s east side has aesthetic lines and windows that curve to create the image of an eye overlooking the centre’s landscaped entrance. The eye is emblematic of PERFORM’s clinical observations towards establishing better nutrition, improved rehabilitation methods, and healthier lifestyle choices for everyone.The north-facing side is constructed entirely of windows to maximize natural light and connect the building’s interior with the outdoor landscape. The interior/exterior ambiance reflects the need for people to maintain a healthy balance with indoor and outdoor activities. Hallways are painted in warm yellow and orange tones for a sunny, welcoming effect. PERFORM also houses Le Centre, which offers Concordia students, faculty, staff and alumni, as well as the public, the opportunity to improve their fitness in a unique conditioning and rehabilitation facility. The open space encased in windows from the building’s surrounding hallways reflects PERFORM’s trilateral focus on research, education and community engagement. Leap, the public art embellishing PERFORM’s façade, was created by Montreal artist Adad Hannah. The large-scale, photo-based work on glass vibrantly depicts a series of 17 people engaged in various physical activities. Concordia students, faculty, and staff members served as models for the art to convey PERFORM’s goal of healthier living for everyone starting with the university’s community.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityPERFORM Centre (Prevention, Evaluation, Rehabilitation and FORMation/training)Campus maps
