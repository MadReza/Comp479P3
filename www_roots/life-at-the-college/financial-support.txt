http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/education/programs/graduate/education-phd/financial-support.htmlSome issues to consider while doing so include:Furthermore, the Department of Education and Concordia University offer several work opportunities as well as bursaries (scholarships) and loans for doctoral students.Graduate studies at Concordia are sustained by an intensive program of faculty research and publication, supported by a healthy level of external funding. We try to offer opportunities to work closely as part of a research team to as many of our graduate students as possible, and through teaching assistantships, some students work closely with professors to further develop their professional skills. The Francis Friedman Resource Center is a space dedicated exclusively to our graduate students, offering them a place to make and call their own.Many students work while studying for their PhD. Doing so not only provides immediate funds, but valuable experience. We advise students that they can work as many as 10 to 20 hours per week without seriously impacting their studies.But where are the opportunities? Here are some possibilities: If you plan to study as an international student and would have a student visa, you are eligible to work (with some restrictions) as many as 20 hours a week during the academic year and full-time during the summer break.Concordia University offer some bursaries (scholarships) and similar types of assistance. These are competitive (PhD students in all programs compete for most of these) and go to the students with the strongest overall academic records.We automatically consider all applicants for bursaries as part of the application process.Several bursaries are also available to current students. We notify students of these opportunities and the application deadlines. Students submit applications for the bursaries of interest.Read more about available bursaries and the criteria for selecting them.Everything to do with financing your education: student loans, scholarships, bursaries, work-study programs, and budgeting guides. Get started here.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFinancial supportDepartment of Education
