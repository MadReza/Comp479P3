These transfers are typically viewed through the lens of family business succession. Yet, succession involves the transfer of financial as well as business assets and the sale of firms when there are no family successors has the potential to generate tremendous family wealth. We are looking to study these business families. Business families are late-generation corporate/family constructions that have reallocated their accumulated capital beyond the founding firm into new commercial and industrial ventures through vehicles such as commercial trusts, family offices, foundations, holding companies, and diversified business groups. While the literature has established that late-generation BFs gradually liquidate their ownership positions in a founding firm the literature largely ignores how assets are reallocated and the roles of family and third-party agents in managing them. In this research program, the post-doc will be involved in investigating a ‘rationalized business family transitions’ hypothesis identifying actors and processes that moderate emotional and dysfunctional tendencies in family firms, which the conventional literature has established are harmful to their survival and performance.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
