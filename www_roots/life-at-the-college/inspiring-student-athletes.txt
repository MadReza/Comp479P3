That’s why Dudar established the Patricia Dudar Athletic Award in 2008, to help student athletes not be burdened by financial stresses and focus on their abilities, both on the track and in the classroom. “You have to return what you’ve been given,” says Dudar of the Planned Giving program. 

Through a planned gift at Concordia, Dudar has guaranteed the track stars of tomorrow will concentrate on winning beyond her lifetime. 
 Planned gifts, oftentimes called legacy giving or living bequests, can support undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, faculty chairs, research, infrastructure and more. 

A planned gift can enable you to make a more significant contribution than you thought possible, while allowing you to achieve financial and tax benefits that help fulfill your philanthropic and estate-planning goals.At Concordia, we have a myriad of planned giving options from which you can choose.
