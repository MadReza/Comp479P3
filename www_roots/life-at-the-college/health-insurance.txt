http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/international/health-insurance.htmlImmigration Quebec regulations require that all international students be covered by a health insurance plan that meets government standards, while studying in Quebec. In keeping with this government directive, Concordia University has negotiated a compulsory health and accident insurance plan with Blue Cross at a competitive cost that all Concordia international students must have. Consequently, personal health insurance plans are not accepted. Students may opt to take couple or family coverage at an additional cost.Students can pick up a Health Insurance card at the ISO after they have registered for courses. Please download and review your Blue Cross Health Insurance Policy Booklet carefully for the details of your coverage. A printed copy of your Policy Booklet will be also given at the Health Insurance Information sessions. Blue Cross also offers additional services. We recommend that you pick up your Blue Cross Health Insurance card and carry it with you at all times. This is your proof of coverage.Effective September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016September 1 – December 31
