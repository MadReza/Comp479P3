http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/cissc/phd-humanities/research-creation.htmlThe Humanities PhD program offers an exceptionally productive and supportive milieu for students entering with an MFA who wish to pursue research-creation projects that combine creative practice in a variety of media with scholarly investigation. Students in the Research-Creation stream declare Studio as one of their three fields, do a Studio exam as one of their three comprehensive exams, and their thesis may include non-paper components – such as digital medial, and audio and visual production – accompanied by a written scholarly text of 150 - 200 pages.Humanities students in the Research-Creation stream and their supervisors are a vital part of Concordia’s cutting-edge and internationally renowned Research-Creation centres and labs, such as Techno culture Art and Games, Hexagram, SenseLab, Centre for Sensory Studies, Centre for Expanded Poetics, Centre for Curating & Public Scholarship.Visit our student profiles section for a sense of the innovative projects of Humanities students in the Research-Creation stream, including work by Kelly Andres, Kate Bevan-Baker, Joanna Donehower, Natalie Doonan, Gwynne Fulton, Sabah Haider, Joanne Hui, Florencia Marchetti, Dayna McLeod, Taien Ng-Chan, Annie Katsura Rollins, Oli Sorenson, and Margaret Westby.
