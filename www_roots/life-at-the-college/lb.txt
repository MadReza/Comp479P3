http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/maps/buildings/lb.htmlThe J. W. McConnell Building opened in 1992 to house the R. Howard Webster Library, teaching and research facilities, the Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery, the J.A. DeSève Cinema and academic and administrative offices.Beginning in 2006 and through 2007, some Social Sciences departments left their spaces in this building to move to the Hall Building, and the Departments of English, History and Études françaises were renovated and consolidated on the sixth and tenth floors.In 2013, the Birks Student Service Centre and the Welcome Centre located onthe ground floor were fully redesigned and the DeSève Cinema was upgraded. In 2015, the Department of Education was relocated to the Faubourg Sainte-Catherine Building, which allowed the library to expand onto the fifth floor to increase the seating capacity and adapt to technological change. The first phase of this project, delivered that fall, offers a variety of study spaces in a totally renewed setting.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityJ.W.
