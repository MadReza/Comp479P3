It is customary to capture both physical and random aspects of these modules to study the inter-relationship of the submodules and the functional and performance/reliability analysis of the complete system. The main objective of this research is to formalize in higher-order-logic some of the commonly used mathematical fundamentals of physics, in particular, quantum, electromagnetics, queueing and control, and use them to reason about some real-world physical systems in the domains of telecommunication, transportation or medicine using theorem proving. This multidisciplinary research enables the acquisition of experience in computer science, formalized mathematics and engineering physics.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
