http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/about/life-at-the-college/history.htmlThe Science College was formed at a time when Concordia University was encouraging the formation of small academic units.A group of Concordia University professors headed by Dr. Elaine Newman got together and formulated the following principles:
The elements of the Science College were chosen with these principles in mind.
A document embodying all the above mentioned facts was presented to the Arts and Science faculty council and then to the Concordia University Senate. It was approved on April 27, 1979. To publicize the new college, the Science College public lectures were created, and they are still one of the major public events of the Science College.As the years have passed there has been a greater demand for this type of programme and the College has grown. In 1979, there were 12 students compared to over 80 currently. But this number is still quite small and with good reason. Small numbers make for an intense learning experience where students get to know and work with each other, question the status quo, get an overview of science as a whole and participate in cutting edge research in three different areas during their tenure. The result is that Science College alumni can be found in top positions in science and medicine, both in Canada and abroad.
