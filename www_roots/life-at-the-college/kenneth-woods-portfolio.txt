http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/kenneth-woods-portfolio.htmlThe Kenneth Woods Portfolio Management Program (KWPMP) was launched in 2000 to provide a select group of undergraduate JMSB students with hands-on training in investment management by working with a real-life portfolio of over $2 million.

A unique program in purpose and size, the KWPMP was established with an initial investment of $1 million by Kenneth Woods, MBA 75, in honour of the late Professor Calvin C. Potter, a much admired member of the Department of Finance who inspired a whole generation of business students.

The KWPMP 2015 Fund Managers placed in the 9th percentile amongst a peer group of Canadian pension managers. They generated 358 bps of alpha and almost 10% of absolute return. Those kinds of numbers can be achieved by seasoned fund managers and it never hurts if the times are good for stock markets. But in 2015, the KWPMP students’ performance was the result of discipline and hard work. They remained true to their style of stock picking undervalued companies. Regardless of market capitalization or sector, they sought out relative value, strong management and growth. They made it seem easy and take with them an enviable track record of out-performance.

Their accomplishment was also acknowledged at the Quinnipiac G.A.M.E. VI Forum Student-Managed Portfolio Competition (undergraduate level). This year, over 140 universities from around the world sent their representatives to the event. The 2015 KWPMP Fund Managers were awarded 1st prize amongst student teams that managed an actual portfolio during the 2015 calendar year.
