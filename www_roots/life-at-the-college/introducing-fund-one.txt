http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/offices/vpaer/aar/2014/06/02/introducing-fund-one.htmlAlumni and friends now have a new way to give to Concordia — crowdfunding. It's a great way for faculty and students to secure project funding.  With the launch of FundOne, Concordia unveils its first crowdfunding platform that will unite members of the community who have an idea and a plan — but not the means — and donors who want to make a difference on a specific project.It’s a peer-to-peer fundraising model that gives donors a clearer idea of how their gifts make a difference.“The idea is to help Concordians spread the word among their networks, to make a direct connection with donors without a middle man.” says FundOne project leader Sophie Johnson, a development officer in Advancement and Alumni Relations.View a current FundOne projectWatch a video in support of 
 Concordia SAE&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;“For example, if a researcher or student is talking about their project at a dinner party and someone says, ‘What a great idea. I’d love to support that,’ FundOne lets them do so easily.”Before making their gift, donors can read about the project and the team behind it, so they know exactly where their money is going.Andrea Cartile, a student in Concordia’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, sees a great opportunity in the new platform. Cartile is vice-president, Marketing and Sponsorship, for Concordia SAE, a chapter of SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers).Every year, Concordia SAE’s 100 students design and build prototype vehicles to compete at international events across the U.S., which draw more than 4,500 students from 500 universities.“Even though we do the majority of the machining ourselves, our prototype vehicles are very costly to manufacture, so the impact of financial support is enormous for SAE,” she says.“With the help of FundOne, we will focus more on learning about everything from vehicle systems to company structure and management — and worry less about whether we will be financially stable enough to bring our hardworking and dedicated teams to the experience of a lifetime that is competition.”Like any donation to Concordia, gifts made through FundOne are eligible for charitable tax receipts.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityIntroducing Concordia’s first crowdfunding platform: FundOneNews
