Light-sensitive proteins called opsins are expressed in genetically defined neural populations. Depending on the opsin, optical activation either stimulates or silences neural activity. These molecules thus provide powerful tools for determining the sufficiency or necessity of signaling in a defined neural population for a given behaviour or physiological process. However, application of these methods is restricted spatially: the wavelengths effective for opsin activation undergo significant scattering in tissue. To circumvent this problem, upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) will be distributed in target brain regions. The UCNPs are tuned to absorb photons at near-IR wavelengths and to upconvert their energy into emissions at shorter wavelengths well-suited for opsin activation. Near-IR wavelengths penetrate deeply into tissue, thus enabling control of entire neural populations in large brain regions. Distribution of UCNPs in brain tissue will be imaged, and their effectiveness as intermediaries in optogenetic activation will be assessed by electrochemical and behavioural means. This is an opportunity to learn and extend cutting-edge methods at the intersection of nanoscience and neuroscience.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
