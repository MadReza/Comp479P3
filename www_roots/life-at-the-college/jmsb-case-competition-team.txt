We select, train and develop academic teams of students to represent the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) at numerous regional, national and international case competitions.The program’s main objective is to expose JMSB students to the diversity and challenges present in today’s evolving marketplace. Students learn to adapt to different business situations and to defend strategic recommendations, giving them an edge in the competitive job market.Why we need your helpThere is a considerable cost associated with developing and maintaining the program, including competition fees, airfare, hospitality, class material and gear.It is a cornerstone of the program that competition participation be accessible to everyone with the drive and passion for business. Against a backdrop of significant cuts to university funding, the JMCC seeks help from the Concordia community to help keep delegate fees to a minimum.The John Molson Competition CommitteeOur committee consists of 17 student volunteers and our faculty advisor, JMCC founder Mark Haber. Hundreds of academic tryouts, hundreds of hours of meetings, dozens of marketing campaigns and a number of regional conferences go into creating a world-leading delegation.We have ambitious plans to make the program sustainable in the long-term by increasing revenue from external sources and decreasing our reliance on funding from the JMSB.When reminiscing about my years at Concordia, my fondest memories are associated with extracurricular experiences, in particular my participation to the Undergraduate Commerce Games. Being part of Concordia’s team, spearheaded by coach Mark Haber, was a fantastic and engaging experience. The values experienced through the program (teamwork, perseverance and excellence) have reinforced the toolkit that have been instrumental to my success in the corporate world.In the last years, I was fortunate to give back time and experience to Concordia as President of the Concordia University Alumni Association and recently as member of the Board of Governors. With university funding under ongoing pressure, I feel another way to give back is to provide financial support for those extracurricular programs that I truly enjoyed at Concordia.If you, too, have benefit from similar extracurricular activities or believe in their benefit, I strongly encourage you to lend your support.Please join me and donate in support of the JMSB Case Competition Team- Philippe Pourreaux, BComm, Finance '00FundOne questions?Email fundone@concordia.ca.© Concordia UniversityAdvancement & Alumni Relations, 514-848-2424, ext. 4856Concordia UniversityJMSB Case Competition TeamAlumni & friends
