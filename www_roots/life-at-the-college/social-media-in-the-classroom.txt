It was also part the diploma course, Definitions of Media and Technology I.Students were asked to reflect on a series of issues related to how universities, who rely on traditional forms of instruction, can meet the learning needs of digitally savvy students. They contributed through online discussions and a conversation, moderated by Shade.

Following the conversation, the students were divided into groups for more focused discussion. Some instructors and web administrators from Concordia also contributed during these discussions.

Questions addressed included: The organizers hope the group’s findings will help shape future institutional policies surrounding the use of social media in classrooms at Concordia.

“One of the overall objectives is to develop a grassroots approach,” said John Bentley, program coordinator and instructional developer at the Centre for Teaching and Learning Services. “We captured these discussions on video so that they can be used to help inform Concordia's planning, policies and guidelines in terms of emerging technologies, social media platforms and learning in the 21st-century classroom.”

As a follow-up to her participation in the discussion, Communication Studies Diploma student Orli Kessel contributed a blog entry detailing her take on social media’s effect on our lives. Read it here.Related links:
