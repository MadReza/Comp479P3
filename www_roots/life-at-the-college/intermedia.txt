http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/studio-arts/programs/graduate/intermedia.htmlThe MFA in Studio Arts is a professional terminal degree. The MFA Program appeals to practicing artists who wish to refine personal content and forms through critical inquiry. Alumni are recognized as multidisciplinary artist-researchers working at the vanguard of their respective practices.In this concentration you will find a venue for diverse practices including performance art, installation, video and electronic art. Integrating theory and practice from diverse sources – including the Humanities, Sciences and Creative Arts – you will develop your practice beyond a singular discipline as you engage with social, political, ecological and gender-based issues. The diversity of student interests and artistic practices results in this concentration’s interdisciplinary atmosphere.The three-year, full-time Intermedia (Video, Performance and Electronic Arts) concentration is grounded both historically and intellectually in interdisciplinary art practices, primarily video, performance and electronic arts. MFA students in this concentration integrate theory and practices from the humanities, sciences and creative arts to produce work based on social, political, ecological, gender-based and other issues. Students are inspired by the plurality of subject matter and methodologies to think critically while conducting research that enables them to locate their own artistic expression within the larger context of contemporary culture.Theory and studio seminars provide an important forum for students to discuss and investigate issues and concerns. Review committees composed of faculty, studio arts graduates and invited artist-critics provide a focused response to studio work and prepare students for their concluding exhibition and defense.Read more: why do your master's at Concordia.Academic RegulationsAdmission Requirements. A Bachelor of Fine Arts or a Bachelor of Arts with a Fine Arts or Fine Arts and Art History major, or an approved equivalent, from a recognized institution and with at least a B average in the major area is required.
