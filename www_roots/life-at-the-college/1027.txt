Bacon and Kim L. LavoieNon-communicable chronic diseases are the largest causes of death and morbidity worldwide. They are accounted for by a cluster of poor health behaviours, e.g., smoking, diet, physical inactivity, medication non-adherence. Traditional approaches to health behaviour change have been centred on healthcare professionals providing information and encouraging patients to engage in good behaviours. The effectiveness of this approach is weak, with success rates of only 5-10%.Motivational communication (MC) is a client-centered theory-driven communication style that encourages patients to express intrinsic motivators for behaviour change and overcome their ambivalence about change. MC incorporates strategies from a variety behaviour change models (motivational interviewing, self-determination theory, social-cognitive theory, etc). The demand for physician training in MC-based approaches has risen steadily over the past decade. However, there is little data on the optimal content, structure and length of this training.The supervisory team have obtained pan-Canadian CIHR funding to the optimal MC training program, as well as, the process mechanisms by which MC competency is gained in physicians. It is anticipated that the new Fellow will be able to build greater depth around the work that they completed in their PhD whilst also gaining a broader perspective of the issues related to behaviour change.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
