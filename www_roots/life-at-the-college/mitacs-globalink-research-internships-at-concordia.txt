According to the regulations of the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), in order to qualify for the reduced-fare transit pass, you must be a full-time student at an institution recognized by Quebec’s Ministère de l’Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport (MELS).Finding Accommodation in Montreal Finding accommodations in Montreal is relatively easy and inexpensive when compared to other major North American cities. To get started on finding out how to search for an apartment in Montreal, please visit Concordia’s page on off-campus housing.Depending on your internship placement dates, you may also be able to request on-campus accommodations. For more information, please visit Summer Accommodations.Pre-departure InformationReview the Concordia website before leaving home and make note of key information (building addresses, phone numbers, office opening hours, etc.) as you may not have internet access immediately when you arrive to Montreal.Verify whether your internship will be conducted at the Sir George Williams (downtown campus) or Loyola campus so that you know where to go on your first day.Once you know when you will be arriving, you should contact your supervising professor to schedule an appointment to meet her or him, visit the location where you will be conducting your research internship and coordinate any other remaining details.Ensure you have some cash with you when you arrive to Montreal, as you may not be able to use your credit card everywhere.Arrival InformationAs soon as you arrive, you should obtain a Concordia University ID.  It will give you access to certain parts of the campus, such as the library, as well as the shuttle bus. To obtain an ID, please take your Letter of Invitation (LOI), Passport, Work Permit and your address in Montreal to Human Resources (Faubourg Tower, 1250 Guy Street, Suite FB-1130).It may take a few days for you to receive your Concordia ID card, therefore you should be prepared to use public transportation to travel between campuses during your first week.Please note: Many university services (e.g. libraries, health services) and administrative offices will have different opening hours during the summer months when GRIs are on campus. You should verify the specific department/office webpage ahead of time to make sure it is open when you plan to visit.Useful Links:Related Pages© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityMitacs Globalink Research Internships at ConcordiaConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
