Damon MatthewsAn important recent development in climate science is the concept of a global carbon budget, which defines the total amount of CO2 emissions that is consistent with a given climate target. It is now well established that global warming responds approximately linearly to cumulative CO2 emissions over time. This finding allows us to estimate the global carbon budget, so as to set a limit on the total quantity of CO2 that can be emitted while maintaining global temperature below a desired level of warming.This post-doctoral research position will focus on improving our current understanding of allowable emissions for ambitious climate targets, with the aim of providing robust and policy-relevant carbon budget estimates for 1.5-2°C of global climate change. The research will include the following objectives:The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
