http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/cissc/phd-humanities/faculty-profiles.htmlHumanities PhD students are able to draw on the expertise and creative excellence of outstanding scholars and artists at Concordia. Students create their own path and pursue unique interdisciplinary projects of research or research-creation (which combines creative practice with scholarly investigation) under the mentorship of an advisory committee of three faculty members: a Major field supervisor (usually in the same discipline as the student’s MA or MFA) and two Minor field advisors.Applicants to the Humanities program are required to approach Concordia faculty members who could serve on their advisory committee, and upload confirmations from them as part of their application. To facilitate the process of identifying faculty members in areas relevant to an applicant’s proposed project, we have provided below links to the faculty profiles of full-time faculty members in departments across the Faculties of Arts and Science and Fine Arts.As well, through their advisory committee Humanities students gain access to Concordia’s many outstanding interdisciplinary teams, such as Milieux’s 7 research clusters (Community and Differential Mobilities; Indigenous Futures; Media History; Performance, Immersion and Interactivity; Post Image; Technoculture Art and Games; Textiles); Hexagram; Matralab; SenseLab; Mobile Media Lab; Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling; Feminist Media Studio; Centre for Sensory Studies, Media History Research Centre, Centre for Expanded Poetics, Centre for Curating & Public Scholarship, and the Loyola Sustainability Research Centre. See as well Research Currents for an illustrative listing of the many areas of interdisciplinary expertise at Concordia and the faculty members whose work has been influential in opening up and charting these fields.  Applicants are encouraged to consult how to approach potential advisors and are welcome to contact the Humanities director with any further questions.  Full-time Faculty members in departments in the Faculty of Arts and ScienceApplied Human SciencesClassics, Modern Languages and LinguisticsCommunication StudiesEconomicsEducationEnglishÉtudes françaisesGeography, Planning and EnvironmentHistoryJournalismLiberal Arts CollegePhilosophyPolitical ScienceReligionSchool of Canadian Irish StudiesSchool of Community and Public AffairsSimone de Beauvoir InstituteSociology and AnthropologyTheological StudiesFull-time Faculty members in departments in the Faculty of Fine Arts Art EducationArt HistoryThe Mel Oppenheim School of CinemaContemporary DanceCreative Arts TherapiesDesign and Computation ArtsMusicStudio ArtsTheatreBelow is an illustrative list of Concordia faculty members who have served on Humanities students’ advisory committees over the last few years.
