McGrath and Jamie EngertThe postdoctoral fellow will pioneer transdisciplinary research at the crossroads of statistical genetics, environmental exposure, and child health. As part of the CIHR-funded AdoQuest II project, the fellow will investigate how airborne nicotine is linked to smoking initiation among children and adolescents. AdoQuest offers exceptional potential to assess etiological contributions through its environmental exposure and GWAS data. Multiple genetic regions have been associated with smoking behaviour, nicotine metabolism, and nicotine dependence. The fellow will: strengthen foundational skills in SNP-analyses (imputation, GWAS, identifying genetic variants); collaborate with geneticists, epidemiologists, statisticians, and preventive health researchers; engage in training initiatives in applied computational genomics; have opportunities for advanced coursework (QICSS, Statistics Canada, Compute Canada); become involved in preventive health knowledge translation activities; receive grantsmanship support and gain experience applying for federal and provincial funding; co-author manuscripts, and present research at international conferences (additional funding available); develop independent projects in preventive health and applied computational genomics; enhance their pedagogical skills through teaching opportunities (workshops at PERFORM Data Science Lab, undergraduate courses); and, gain experience co-supervising undergraduate thesis projects. The postdoctoral scholar will have exceptional opportunity to become immersed within the preventive health community at PERFORM and to benefit from collaborations with Concordia’s Centre for Clinical Research in Health (CCRH) and Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (CSFG), and McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (MUGQIC). The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
