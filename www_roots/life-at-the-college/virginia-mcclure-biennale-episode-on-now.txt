Each artist recognizes the historical heritage of ceramics, yet offers a highly original and imaginatively provocative vision.“The exhibition is deceptively clear. The complexity of the materials in play and the issues involved slowly unfolds to you. As you walk in, the first piece is made of raw clay, it’s extremely fragile and seems to suggest ideas about our own mortality,” says Swanson.25 Concordia students assisted the artists setting up the show and creating installations over a five-day period.  Épisode is the second of five biennales taking place between 2014 and 2022. The first in the series, Caméléon was curated by another Concordian, Associate Professor, Jean-Pierre Larocque two years ago. The Visual Arts Centre which houses the McClure Gallery was originally founded as a clay guild and the biennale honours Virginia McClure’s life-long engagement with ceramics.Virginia McClure Ceramic Biennale: Épisode • Phoebe Cummings, Benjamin DeMott, Janet Macpherson, Meghan Smythe.
