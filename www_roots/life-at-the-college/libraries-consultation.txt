http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/strategic-directions/archives/consultations/libraries-consultation.htmlThis is a time of change for Concordia University Library. Academic libraries are embracing digital culture in all aspects of their mission: collections, services and space.  Major achievements do not happen by chance. Therefore, it is essential that we, as students, faculty, support staff, librarians, all members of the Concordia community, determine what kind of library we want and what we need to do to get there. This planning exercise is part of the Concordia University Strategic Directions process that started at the beginning of 2015. I invite all members of the Libraries’ team and the Concordia community in general to participate in the strategic directions consultation. Everyone has valuable ideas and comments to contribute as we determine the vision and the roadmap for the future of our Libraries. Join the discussion!Please attend one of the consultation sessions listed below, and send any comments, questions, or suggestions to the Library's Strategic Directions Advisory Committee at
