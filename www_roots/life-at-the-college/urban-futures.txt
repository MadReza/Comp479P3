http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/cissc/working-groups/urban-futures.htmlThe CISSC Urban Futures working group is geared towards facilitating dialogue and exchanges on research, creative, and pedagogical engagements with cities. The aims of this working group are to create a space for bringing together faculty, artists and researchers, as well as graduate students, whose research and practice is tethered to urban issues writ large, including: sustainability, arts and culture, architecture and design, and themes such as resilience, reconciliation, migration and urban transformation, the right to the city, media ecology, queer urbanisms, environmental humanism, citying, futuricity, and more. The literature on these topics is broad, but what is relatively new is a shift in thinking about urban futures across disciplines (arts, business, social sciences) on these topics. CISSC Urban Futures working group will undertake a rigorous exploration of possible urban futures through cross-disciplinary collaborative research strategies and embedded and embodied urban explorations.Our core team will share the facilitation of this working group and its activities. Our aim is to create mutually supporting structures (of which the working group is one) that will create a complex scaffold for advanced investigations concerning the urban fabric—its flows, resistances, and resiliencies—and ideas of futurism, speculative design, and fabulist site specific practice. The research and practice scaffold is not only intellectual but has a physical dimension as well: the nascent Institute for Urban Futures—which will be significantly formed and fed through the work of the Urban Futures working group in the next year—has an HQ in the new cooperative space Temps Libre located in the heart of the Mile-End neighbourhood. We anticipate that many of the events, gatherings, exhibitions, walks, documents, performances, and urban interventions emerging from the Urban Futures working group will be staged from this site as well as from the downtown campus of Concordia. Carmela Cuzuccella, Department of Design and Computation ArtsJill Didur, Department of EnglishRebecca Duclos, Dean of the Faculty of Fine ArtsCynthia Hammond, Department of Art HistoryShauna Janssen, Department of TheatreSome core critical questions guiding this working group (to be developed) include:Carmela Cuzuccella, Department of Design and Computation ArtsJill Didur, Department of EnglishRebecca Duclos, Dean of the Faculty of Fine ArtsCynthia Hammond, Department of Art HistoryShauna Janssen, Department of TheatreJohanne Sloan, Art HistoryNicola Pezolet, Art HistoryRhona Richman Kenneally, Design and Computation Artspk langshaw, Design and Computation ArtsRilla Khaled, Design and Computation ArtsCatherine Russell, Film StudiesJoshua Neves, Film StudiesErin Manning, Film StudiesJean-Claude Bustros, Film ProductionMichael Montanaro, DanceAngélique Willkie, DanceLeila Sujir, IntermediaLaura Endacott, Fibres and Material PracticesLinda Swanson, CeramicsFrançois Morelli, Painting and DrawingMark Sussman, TheatreRicardo del Farra, MusicKathleen Vaughan, Art EducationJanis Timm-Bottos, Creative Art TherapyOrit Halpern, Sociology and Anthropology and Computational Arts DepartmentSilvano De la Llata, Geography, Urban Planning and EnvironmentNorma Rantisi, Geography, Urban Planning and EnvironmentJulie Podmore, Geography, Urban Planning and EnvironmentA workshop on vacancy and putting temporary use strategies to work in Montreal

BYOB reception to followDr. Linnaea Tillett is founder and principal of Tillett Lighting Design Associates, New York.  Tillett has worked with some of the world's foremost architects and artists on lighting design in public, private, and museal space.  Her firm's approach is informed by her research in environmental psychology, and her respect for the delicate ecology of the night, which includes many light-sensitive flora and fauna.  While responding to human need for illumination, her firm takes the stance that, when lighting the night, less is poetically, environmentally, and emotionally, more.
