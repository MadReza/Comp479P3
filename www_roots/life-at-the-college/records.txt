http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/records.htmlAll Concordia students, and all university students in Quebec, must register at least once with the Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur (MEES). We can help you with the following tasks, because they affect the tuition you will pay at Concordia: It's important that you read these sections and follow the guidelines provided so you can benefit from one, or both, of these conditions for studying in Quebec.Every student studying at a Quebec University must have a permanent code or code permanent. This code is assigned by the Ministry. Concordia needs you to have a permanent code. Without one, you will pay an extra differential tuition fee.International students, Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents in Undergraduate and Graduate programs at Concordia pay higher tuition fees than Quebec residents.To pay Quebec resident tuition fees, you must qualify as a Quebec resident under MEES definitions. If you do not qualify for Quebec Resident Tuition Status (as outlined above), you normally have to pay additional tuition fees. However, if you register in approved French programs or courses, these fees maybe waived.Some international students qualify for Quebec tuition fee rates under MEES rgulations. See if you qualify.Office of the Registrar© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStudying in QuebecStudent hub
