Though not required to write class assignments or final examinations, they participate in every other aspect of the courses.Concordia University is committed to lifelong learning and community service, in recognition of which seniors at Concordia can study for credit in a program or as Independent students. Since the creation of the Senior Non-Credit Program in 1983, they may also choose to audit courses as Independent students on a non-credit basis at a significantly reduced fee.Location: La Tour du Faubourg 1600 Ste-Catherine St. W.
