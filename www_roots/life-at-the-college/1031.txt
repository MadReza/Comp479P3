On a national level, as of 2011, nearly 250,000 Canadians were diagnosed with this type of viral infection. These numbers continue to grow even though advances in modern medicine have brought forth cures that can be administered over a 2 to 3-month therapeutic window. However, despite the advances such therapies may deliver, a major concern is the emergence of drug-resistant variants of the virus. As such, there exists a need to develop novel nanomedicinal therapeutic paradigms that can target viral infections resulting in: (i) highly specific and tailored drug delivery, (ii) a higher degree of efficacy and (iii) lower therapeutic dosage requirements, which will reduce the nefarious side effects often experienced with conventional passive administration routes.The proposed research program seeks to develop novel nanoparticle constructs that can selectively target viruses and deliver an antiviral therapeutic agent. The proposed program is highly multidisciplinary and will require an exceptional postdoctoral candidate to ensure its success.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada, a diverse and creative city, often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living experiences in North America.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFellowship DescriptionResearch program titleReference numberSupervisorProgram descriptionAcademic qualifications requiredEligibility requirementsTimeline and application processApplication checklistValueConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
