AghdamIn this research, it is desired to assess the connectivity of an asymmetric network using an algebraic measure. The relationship between the network connectivity and the rate of convergence to consensus is to be investigated. It is aimed here to develop a distributed algorithm so that only information collected from the neighboring nodes is used to compute the network connectivity. Computational efficiency of the algorithm is of utmost importance. It is also desired to configure the network in such a way that its connectivity is maximized. The results of this research are expected to help better understand the characteristics of asymmetric networks, and design more effective network control systems.
