Omair Ahmad and M.N.S. SwamyImage restoration is widely used in areas involving images such as astronomy, remote sensing, microscopy, medical imaging, photography, surveillance, and HDTV systems. For example, license plates may appear illegible due to motion blur; photographs captured under low-light conditions may suffer from noise; out-of-focus photographs may look blurred; standard TV signals may not be sufficiently sharp for high definition TV sets; archived movies may be corrupted by artifacts and noise; atmospheric distortions may degrade the quality of images in remote sensing. For such cases and in many other scenarios, the importance of image restoration ranges from beneficial to essential. This project will address some of these real life challenges as faced by the IT industry.The prestigious Horizon Postdoctoral Fellowships are valued at $47,500 per year plus benefits and full access to Concordia’s services, including GradProSkills.Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities and many research centers.
