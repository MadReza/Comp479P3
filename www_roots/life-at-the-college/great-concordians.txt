http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/alumni-friends/applause/great-concordians.htmlConcordia celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2014. To mark the occasion we honour Great Concordians — authors, athletes, thinkers, public servants and entrepreneurs — who serve as models for our next generation of students. Each Great Concordian was selected by a special committee overseen by the Office of the Provost that included staff, faculty, university leaders, students and alumni representatives.© Concordia UniversityAdvancement & Alumni Relations, 514-848-2424, ext. 4856Concordia UniversityGreat ConcordiansAlumni & friends
