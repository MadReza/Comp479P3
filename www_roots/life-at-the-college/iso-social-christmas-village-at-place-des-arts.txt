Every Christmas, Montreal’s Place des Arts turns into a huge Christmas Market, featuring artisanal products from all over the province, music and lots of fun!

We will first meet at ISO Office (H-653) at 4:00PM, then we will take a walk on St Catherine to Place des Arts. Please remember to bring some cash in case you would like to buy something at the village!

We look forward to seeing you!In order to participate, please register online here.
