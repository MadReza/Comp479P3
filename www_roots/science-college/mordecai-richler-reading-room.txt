http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/english/about/mordecai-richler-reading-room.htmlThe Mordecai Richler Reading Room is curated by the English department. The space is designed to inspire creative writers, spark fresh ideas among students, and foster original research from scholars. We use it as a gathering place for literary readings, master classes, cultural gatherings and short writing residencies.Concordia is the home of Mordecai Richler’s desk, typewriter, some of his private papers, books and mementos, as well as an ashtray that once brimmed over with his cigars. Located on the sixth floor of the J. W. McConnell Library Building, the room is at the heart of Richler’s old haunts at Concordia’s Sir George Williams Campus.The author’s personal effects were generously donated to the Department of English by Richler’s literary estate thanks to Frederick Lowy — Concordia president and vice-chancellor from 1995 to 2005 and again from January 2011 until July 2012 — who championed the opening of the Mordecai Richler Reading Room to honour its namesake.The Mordecai Richler Reading Room is closed to the general public.  Research related inquiries should be directed to Bonnie-Jean Campbell, Graduate Program Assistant (bonnie.campbell@concordia.ca). Students in our graduate program are cataloging the author's personal library and creating a database that includes details on marginalia by the author, found in individual books. For more information on this project, please contact Dr. Jason Camlot (jason.camlot@concordia.ca).
