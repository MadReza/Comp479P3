These firms later secured millions of dollars in contracts from the municipal administration.As reported in the Gazette, Gyulai said: “We should be deeply concerned about the ability of freelance journalists and news organizations with small or shrinking budgets to fight protracted legal battles for access-to-information against cities and governments with deeper pockets.”“This is a well-deserved honor for Linda, who’s an outstanding investigative reporter,” says Brian Gabrial, chair of Concordia’s Department of Journalism. “Graduates like her make our department extremely proud.”Related linksSearch for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityVictory over city hall earns press accoladeDepartment of Journalism
