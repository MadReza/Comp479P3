http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/sociology-anthropology/student-life/new-students.htmlDear Student,You will find enclosed a number of reminders regarding the completion of your program of study in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology.PLEASE REMEMBER, first, that it is your responsibility to make sure that your course selection and registration is correct and complete, and that you observe the University's regulations and deadlines. For this purpose, you need to read the university calendar. It is available both in paper form and on the website of the university. In the calendar, you will find all the relevant information regarding your course of study.You can also obtain a form on the department website or in the department that reproduces your specific course of study as it is indicated in the calendar.Second, if students follow a certain progression of taking courses, they will not be left in their final year with course conflicts or lacking courses for the completion of their degree as is often the case with required courses such as ANTH 315, SOCI 310, SOCI 300 and so forth. Courses have prerequisites for a reason. Prerequisites need to be taken before a higher level course, not at the same time.Here is the course plan that the department expects students to follow.
 Fall TermWinter TermDuring their first 30 credits, students should complete their General Education requirements.Fall TermWinter TermDuring their first 30 credits, students should complete their General Education requirements.Fall TermWinter TermDuring their first 30 credits, students should complete their General Education requirements.Students should take all the required courses such as SOCI 310, SOCI 300, ANTH 301 and ANTH 315 (depending on your specific program) in their second year, so as to have the prerequisites to register for 400-level courses.This is the time to complete your 300 and 400-level course requirements. Students are welcome to see advisors in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. When visiting an advisor, students must bring their transcript. In the case of new students, they must also bring their acceptance letter.Students who desire to make inquiries by e-mail should write to the advising address: socanth.fas@concordia.caEnjoy your program and good luck,Aaron Brauer
