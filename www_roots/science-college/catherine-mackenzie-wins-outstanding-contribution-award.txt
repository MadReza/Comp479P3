http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/finearts/2014/04/01/catherine-mackenzie-wins-outstanding-contribution-award.htmlThe Concordia Council on Student Life (CCSL) is the highest body in the University dedicated to student life. It is a parity committee made of equal numbers of students and staff and faculty. CCSL recognizes outstanding individuals at Concordia via the Outstanding Contribution Award, which can be given to any member of the Concordia community, including students, staff, and faculty. Students in undergraduate and graduate programs in the Department of Art History nominated Dr Catherine MacKenzie for this award based on her outstanding contribution as a teacher and mentor in the undergraduate and graduate programs in the Department of Art History.  Dr MacKenzie was also particularly acknowledged for her research and teaching about Nazi-looted art objects, the subject of several ground-breaking seminars she has taught in recent years, in which students identified the provenance of major works of art held in high-profile collections, and being sold at world-class auctions. Through her activism, and that of her students, important works of art have been returned to their rightful owners.

Dr MacKenzie was honoured at the Loyola Chapel, Concordia University on Thursday, April 3, 2014 alongside 9 other students, faculty, and staff, and an additional 11 recipients of the 2014 Volunteer Award.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityDr Catherine MacKenzie wins Outstanding Contribution AwardNews
