Our monthly Cook-Out offers the opportunity for student parents and their children to meet each other and cook a meal together.  As a bonus you can bring home some leftovers for those busy nights!During the Fall Term we organize a winter coat bazaar where slightly used coats are donated, for you and your children, before the winter cold begins.   During the Winter Term we organize a toy bazaar where slightly used toys are donated and available for your children.Once a term we organize a Café Rencontre where you will have the opportunity to discover some unique programs that are offered by Concordia for you as a student.Let us take care of your children while you study!
 Register for this bi-monthly program that will give you a couple of hours to work on your studies during the weekend.The purpose of the workshop is to give children the tools and guidance they need to create & appreciate art, as well as give the student teachers who are running the program the opportunity to grow as art educators.  The activities could vary between arts & crafts, drawing, painting, collage, sculpture, etc.Parents are welcome to use this free time to relax or study at CUSP.
