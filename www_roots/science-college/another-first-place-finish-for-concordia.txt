In the past seven years, Concordia has won the competition six times.The JMSB team, made up of Coutinho-De Somma, Sabrina Jorrin and Stephanie Groulx, received a $1,500 cash prize and a $500 bursary to the school’s competition program, donated by the Canadian HR Press. Each member was also awarded a Certified Human Resources Professional study guide.After the event, Head Coach and Advisor to the Competition Program, Mark Haber acknowledged the role of the team’s coaches Romy Schnaiberg and Matt Fishman. “This would not have been possible without them,” he said. “I also want to thank (long-time lead coach) Aaron Dresner for his commitment to this competition. He has been coaching HR since 2007 but was not able to coach this year.”
