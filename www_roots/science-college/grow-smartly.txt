http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/strategic-directions/nine-directions/grow-smartly.htmlAdd capacity where our strengths and emerging enrolment demand intersectAs we continue to grow over the next decade, Concordia needs to be strategic about where and how this growth occurs.Being smart about increased enrolments means targeting promising program niches that aren’t yet occupied. It means tapping the potential of learning technologies. It means developing stronger connections between faculty expertise and program offerings.Growth must be grounded in an unwavering commitment to high-quality learning experiences, and it requires careful consideration of what might be done differently or stopped altogether in order to provide the capacity to move in new directions. Mandate: Develop a strategy for growth and set the bases for more strategic enrolment management at Concordia.
Read the cross-institutional strategy for Grow Smartly.The strategy was developed with Senate's Academic Planning and Priorities Committee, in close consultation with Faculty Deans and Associate Deans, as well as with the University Registrar.directions@concordia.ca#CUdirections© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStrategic directions
