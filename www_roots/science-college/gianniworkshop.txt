In particular, he will explore the main empirical, analytical, and normative issues related to the challenges multiculturalism entails for citizenship, democracy and justice, and will focus on the modalities through which specific public policies are mobilized, legitimized, and debated in public space.He will also address the implications that such policies have on the recognition / misrecognition of “other”, and their normative implications for culturally divided societies. The case study of Muslim integration in Europe will be taken as a guiding example in the discussion.This will be an extremely rich and thought provoking workshop, don’t miss out!© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
