The other equipment cannot be booked for more than 1 week. Depending on your course assignment, your professor may have pre-arranged a different duration with the Technical Office. Booking extensions are based upon availability and granted on a case by case basis.Virtually all resources are provided with the original instruction manual. You may have received some training from your professor or the TA. You can also make an appointment with the Tech Office for quick tutorials or advice.Depending on your course, it may have been discussed in class. It is best to contact us for your individual needs, but generally speaking, you’ll need a Digital Video Camera. If you’re recording sound, you’ll want to choose a microphone that’s appropriate for the shooting conditions, and for the final product. If you’re recording sound from two microphones, you’ll need to book the Canon XA-10. Finally, if you want to control lighting while you’re recording, you’ll need a lighting kit (LOW).MacBookPro 13 in. i7 2.9GHz IntelEdirol R-09HROlympus WS802Canon XA10 High Definition CamcorderCanon VIXIA HF R52Wacom Intuos3 (9x12)Lowel DV Core 500 Kit (with case)LED lightiPadPadcaster KitCanon T5i SLRUSB SpeakerPhone - Quattro3 MT301 USB Conference SpeakerphonePortable Data Projector
