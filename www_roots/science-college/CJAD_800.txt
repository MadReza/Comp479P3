The subject (s) can be light or hard-news, can be thought-provoking, ground-breaking or uplifting. The documentaries can be about a person, an event or a happening. Anything goes (although I think the students should probably submit their idea to someone before producing).  Open to: All students who have completed JOUR 330 or JOUR 530Citizenship: Open to Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents onlyLENGTH: 5-7 minutes maximumEach applicant must submit three multimedia copies of:- audio documentary with a brief article- photos or videoCOPYRIGHT/OFFENSIVE MATERIAL: You should avoid any use of material that you do not have the rights to and that you should keep the audience in mind when producing.  Avoid any offensive material altogether or bleep out as needed.CJAD 800 and CJAD.com: While students will retain control of their own material – CJAD 800 also retains the right to broadcast the documentaries and to house them on CJAD.com.  This means all of the entries – not just the winning entries.Due date: noon on Friday, January 15, 2016Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCJAD 800 Gord Sinclair Radio Award $2,500.00 valueDepartment of Journalism
