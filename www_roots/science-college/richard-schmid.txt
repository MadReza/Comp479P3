                Selected publications   Richard Schmid's Explore Concordia pageDr. Schmid is an educational psychologist who conducts research in the following areas:
Given that educational technology is an applied field, he is also   active in internships and theses carried out in local, national and   international communities. This work involves supervised projects in   analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation of learning   and performance support environments in all levels of education, the   private sector, not-for-profit organizations, NGOs, and government.He is the Associate Director of the Centre for the Study of Learning   and Performance (CSLP) Established in 1988 and based at Concordia   University, the (CSLP) is a research centre consisting of over 50   principal members, research collaborators and/or associates, 16 support   staff, and over 40 graduate students. The objectives of the CSLP are   fourfold: to increase the theoretical and practical understanding of the   factors that promote and hinder the learning and performance of complex   skills; to provide training and support to educators and   administrators; to provide the educational community with material and   intellectual resources regarding new ideas in education; and to train   students who have an interest in learning and performance and who are   enrolled in graduate studies within the departments with which the   centre and its members are affiliated.He is a Certified Psychologist - State of ArizonaBA St. John's University, August 1973
