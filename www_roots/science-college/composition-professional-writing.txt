Even if you don't study English literature, you can take English courses. Check out our list of composition courses, or consider our Minor in Professional Writing.  If you would like to enroll in a Composition course, you must first take a 45-minute placement test to determine the course level that is best suited to your writing needs.  You will be asked to write a short essay response to an assigned topic.  You will also need to show your Concordia ID card or, if you are a new student, your letter of admission and a photo ID. 
We offer a minor in Professional Writing that gives you training as writing specialists in many professional areas, including business and technical writing.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityComposition & professional writingDepartment of English
