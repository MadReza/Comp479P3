What lessons have we learned over the years? What problems seem to arise consistently across cases? How can we make our democratic system more prudent while also maintaining efficiency and effectiveness?With over a decade of experience as auditor general at the provincial and federal levels, Mr. Ferguson provides a most unique vantage point from which to view the state of affairs here in Canada.Take advantage of this opportunity and be part of the conversation!Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
