When you study computer science and mathematics, you’ll use algorithms and computational theory to create mathematical models or define formulas that solve mathematical problems. In other words, you'll design new tools that can predict the future.The Computer Applications option gives students the flexibility to combine a traditional computer science degree with a non-traditional field. Our state-of-the-art labs for high-performance computing, networks and artificial intelligence will give you experience with the tools you’ll use in the field. Through labs, lectures and projects, you’ll also:A Bachelor of Computer Science, a Bachelor of Science or a Bachelor of Arts degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background. The core provides a basic and broad study of theory, mathematical basics, programming methodology, computer architecture, data structures, operating systems, and software engineering.The Mathematics and Statistics option combines a Major in Computer Science with a Major in Mathematics and Statistics. It provides a foundation for integrated studies in computer science and mathematics. The mathematics component of the program includes topics that overlap with computer science, such as modeling, symbolic computation, and combinations, as well as the standard topics of a mathematical curriculum.We offer an honours program to computer science students with high academic standing. You may apply to the honours program once you have completed 30 credits.See full degree requirements in the Undergraduate Calendar.Applicants who do not meet the minimum requirements or with partial prerequisites are encouraged to apply and will be reviewed holistically. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program.Admission is based on applicants' overall CRC, including above-average grades in mathematics and physics, and completion of the following classes as part of their DEC.

Prerequisites for all BCompSc programs (except the Computer Systems Option):
 MATH 103 or 201-NYA and 203 or 201-NYB and 105 or 201-NYC

Cegep applicants completing a three-year technical DEC in a related field are eligible for admission if they meet the overall CRC requirements. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program. Students may be eligible for exemptions/transfer credits based on course equivalencies.Prerequisites for all BCompSc programs (except the Computer Systems Option):
 Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra

Transfer credits may be considered on a course‑by‑course basis.Students will be assessed according to their educational background. Some or all prerequisites will be added to the program at Concordia. IB Standard Level courses (SL) are not eligible for exemptions. Students from Bacc. Français schools with Série ES may be considered for admission to some programs.Prerequisites for all BCompSc programs (except the Computer Systems Option): MathEngineering students are able to add a minor in another discipline once they have completed at least 21 credits and if they maintain a GPA of 2.70.
