Creative writing students also have the opportunity to supplement their regular courses with master classes conducted by internationally renowned writers during the Writers Read at Concordia series. Concordia has hosted writers such as Colm Tóibín, Julian Barnes, Jorrie Graham, Mark Strand, Miriam Toews and George Saunders.Montreal’s vibrant English-language literary scene offers a showcase for the work of student writers as well as published authors.
