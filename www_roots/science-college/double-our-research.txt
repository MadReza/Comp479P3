http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/strategic-directions/nine-directions/double-our-research.htmlPursue bold goals in research that reflect our talents and our ambition to tackle big challengesUniversity research has profound social and economic impact, and it acts as a talent magnet that helps build thriving cities and regions.Concordia has made remarkable gains in research over the past 10 years, and we’re poised for another period of substantial growth in our overall research profile, as well as increased recognition for our areas of specialization.In the years ahead, we’ll attract substantially higher levels of external funding, broaden and deepen our societal impact, and more thoroughly integrate research into all of our students’ learning experiences. Mandate: Devise strategies to help Concordia double the intensity and impact of its research.
Leader: Graham Carr, Vice-President, Research and Graduate StudiesRead the cross-institutional strategy for Double our Research.The vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies convened an ad hoc committee comprising members of the University Research Committee and the Senate Research Committee to lead the strategy development work.The Office of the Vice-President of Research and Graduate Studies consulted widely with the research community, and additional input was sought from academic departments and individual faculty, staff, and students via a questionnaire.Note: The strategy will build on recommendations of the strategic directions Idea Group focused on research, along with feedback from the Concordia community submitted during phase one of the Strategic Directions process.directions@concordia.ca#CUdirections© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStrategic directions
