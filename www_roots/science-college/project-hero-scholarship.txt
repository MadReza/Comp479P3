http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/financial-support/scholarships-awards/internal/project-hero-scholarship.htmlConcordia University is pleased to be the first institution in Québec to support the Project Hero Scholarship initiative.

Project Hero is an initiative started by Kevin Reed who was recently appointed honorary lieutenant-colonel of 31 Service Brigade, an army reserve unit headquartered in London, Ontario. Mr. Reed was inspired by the work of former Chief of Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, (Retired) now Chancellor of Memorial University, and approached him about starting a program which would provide a scholarship or tuition waiver for the children of Canadian Forces staff who were killed while on active duty. Mr. Hillier was quick to embrace the idea.

Candidates for the Project Hero Scholarship must:
- Be a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident,
- Be aged 26 years or younger,
- Be a dependent child of Canadian Forces personnel deceased while serving in an active mission (operational mission or training for such a mission dating back to February 2002 for both theatres of combat and peacekeeping missions).

The scholarship is intended to assist with tuition expenses, and is available to full-time students enrolled in Bachelor's programs meeting all of the above-stated criteria. The scholarship is renewable on the basis of continuing full-time enrollment and a minimum GPA of 3.30. Candidates wishing to be considered for this award must contact Doug Gardhouse, Undergraduate Awards Manager (Financial Aid and Awards Office).Contact usFinancial Aid & Awards Office© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityProject Hero ScholarshipStudent hub
