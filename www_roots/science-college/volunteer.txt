http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/international/living-working/volunteer.htmlVolunteers are fundamental to the success of the ISO's outreach program. You will provide the assistance needed to welcome, orient, and help new international students when they first arrive on campus. If you are a positive, caring and outgoing individual who knows their way around campus and who is familiar with Montreal, then the ISO Volunteer program is for you!We are always recruiting volunteers to assist with projects in the ISO, and many other departments reach out to us for volunteers. If you are interested in becoming an ISO Volunteer please fill out the online form below. By signing up to be a volunteer, your name and contact information will be added to a database. ISO Volunteer activities usually run from Monday to Friday between 9:00 am and 5:00. How you choose to volunteer your time is up to you. Signing up comes without obligations. Remember the questions that you had when you first arrived? Now you can probably answer many of them and be a good guide to a new student. If you have free time, the ISO needs you and your fellow international students also need you!Volunteers make all the difference! Your support is much appreciated!(514) 848-2424, ext. 3515Fax: 514-848-3599iso@concordia.ca
