We look at management practices from an interdisciplinary perspective, giving you the kind of big picture understanding of business that employers want.
Students can create a schedule that fits their needs, choosing from morning, afternoon or evening classes. Part-time and full-time students have access to the same class schedule options.Students acquire the skills that employers are looking for both in the classroom and out in the field through real business case projects and experiential learning options.Students can choose to focus on a specific area or explore different aspects of management. Cross-disciplinary themes help students choose their electives to create unofficial specializations.• Business analytics
