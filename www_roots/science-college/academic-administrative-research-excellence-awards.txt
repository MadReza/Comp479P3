http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2015/04/28/academic-administrative-research-excellence-awards.htmlIt’s springtime at Concordia. The last snowbanks have melted, street sweepers are dusting off the sidewalks, the bicycle racks are filling up, and there’s a growing tendency to linger outside a while longer.This is also the time of year when the university recognizes the exceptional contributions of its dedicated faculty members. “Our professors work extremely hard to provide an outstanding learning and research environment at Concordia, and it’s vital that we recognize their commitment and excellence,” says provost Benoit-Antoine Bacon.Award season begins May 14 with a special celebration to honour the latest recipients of the Curriculum Innovation Fund (CIF). A joint effort of the Office of the Provost and the School of Graduate Studies, the fund upholds an objective of the university's Academic Plan, to provide students with dynamic programs and engaging learning experiences.During the first two rounds of funding, in November 2013 and March 2014, CIF supported 15 course transformation projects and eight program transformation proposals.Each year, Concordia’s Academic Leadership Award is given to an individual who has contributed exceptionally to the university through the performance of administrative functions. Last year’s winner was June Chaikelson, a professor in the Department of Psychology and one of the university’s longest-serving faculty members.With the Emerging Academic Leadership Award, the university recognizes a faculty member who hasn’t yet served in an administrative role, but has proven him or herself as a vital driving force. Glenn Cowan, an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, was last year’s recipient of the award.The Academic Leadership Award will be presented during a special celebration hosted by Concordia’s provost in the Loyola-Jesuit Refectory Hall on May 27.At the same event on May 27, the provost will also announce the new inductees to the Provost’s Circle of Distinction.Created in 2009, the Circle of Distinction recognizes faculty members and librarians who have gained academic or professional accolades from prestigious external groups and organizations, such as a fellowship with the Royal Society of Canada or membership in the Order of Canada. Last year there were 10 new inductees into the Circle.The President’s Excellence in Teaching Awards will be presented during a special ceremony on June 2. Given annually, the awards recognize the exceptional pedagogical contributions of full-time and part-time faculty.Philippe Caignon, chair of the Département d’études françaises, was one of four winners last year. A few months previous, Caignon had received a 3M National Teaching Fellowship, Canada’s highest recognition for teachers.“I’m very proud and honoured to have the opportunity to celebrate some of our very best. Their passion for teaching and research; their success in institutional leadership roles; as well as their accomplishments as leaders, moves us forward as a university and benefits the entire academic community,” says provost Bacon.
