That was especially true for “bachelors of a different sort” — queer men.The book gives readers an inside look at turn-of-the century bachelorhood by offering case studies of the private lives and homes of several prominent gay bachelors living in Britain. Potvin explores a largely unseen side of queer sexuality by showing how these bachelors used interior design to set themselves apart from the stifling constraints of the hetero-patriarchy that surrounded them.The Historians of British Art Book Prize recognizes scholarship related to British art and architecture, broadly conceived in terms of place and time.Potvin's latest book, Oriental Interiors: Design, Identity, Space, an edited volume with Bloomsbury Publishers (London), is now available.
