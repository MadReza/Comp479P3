Developed by associate professor Janis Timm-Bottos from the Department of Creative Arts Therapies, art hives are designed to stimulate the imagination, informally build art skills and foster community among neighbours.Associate professor Kathleen Vaughan from the Department of Art Education will challenge students to study the permanent collection in the new MMFA pavilion, then create accompanying sound installations that encourage museum visitors to reflect on issues surrounding social justice and peace.Offered this fall term in the Department of Art History by professor Loren Lerner, the Family Works course focuses primarily on a selection of images from the MMFA collections to highlight unexpected interpretations about the family, children and childhood identity.An arts-based initiative to work with diverse communities in Montreal around the issue of suicide developed by Creative Arts Therapies associate professor Yehudit Silverman. This project will include community workshops, a community-based multimedia exhibition, interactive activities, and the screening of Silverman’s film, The Hidden Face of Suicide.Led by Creative Arts Therapies associate professor Josée Leclerc, participants in the Douglas Institute’s Eating Disorders Program reflect on the impact of art exposure and art therapy on their sense of well-being during closed-group workshops. It’s already underway.A second project, in partnership with the Montreal Heart Institute, in association with Leclerc, will study the effect of art and art therapy on clients with rhythmic heart problems.This 18-credit graduate program, being developed by professor Richard Lachapelle from the Department of Art Education, will enable training in the museum setting, including internships. For the first time, the MMFA will contribute to Concordia’s certification process.Professor Miranda D’Amico from the Department of Education, co-director of the Centre for the Arts in Human Development, will develop autism-related programming in collaboration with the MMFA.To provide visitors a meaningful learning experience through dialogue, Concordia’s Centre for Continuing Education will continue to provide prospective volunteer guides specific skills to help them facilitate group learning in the museum's collections.Next spring, the Zone Éducation-Culture urban planning initiative, in partnership with the City of Montreal, will announce new links between Quartier Concordia and Quartier du Musée that are currently under development.
