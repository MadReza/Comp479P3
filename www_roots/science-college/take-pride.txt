Shaped by the progressive and humanist commitments of its founding institutions, Concordia today reflects the diversity and texture of Montreal, with an educational mission that continues to be premised on inclusiveness, connection, and social mobility.We honour our inheritance as we work together to design a great university for the era to come. This task is demanding, and it requires the entire community to strive for first-rate work, and to be intentional about marking and celebrating our successes.Facing a changing postsecondary landscape, it’s up to us to realize Concordia’s potential, and do ourselves proud.
