With the advent of diversified media coverage and a 24-hour news cycle, political campaigns have become a crucial part of Canadian elections. Most important are the ways in which campaigns are used to strategically manipulate voters.In this talk, Dr. Richard Johnston, Professor and Canada Research Chair in Public Opinion, Elections, and Representation at the University of British Columbia, will take you through the various approaches to understanding how ads, news, and other media factors get inside voters’ heads, how voters' perceptions and opinions matter, what the difference is between conversion versus mobilization, and how the institutional context shapes a campaign.Join us on May 25th to discuss campaigns and why they matter!Participation is open to everyone, but you must register to attend.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
