http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/english/student-life/writing-at-concordia.htmlConcordia has always attracted talented writers as students, faculty, and visitors because we are a national hub for English-language writing. Here's how you can become an active member in this unique community.
The tradition of literary readings at Concordia predates the existence of the university itself, as such events were held well before Sir George Williams and Loyola merged in 1974. The series, now known as Writers Read at Concordia, invites renowned and emerging authors, both Canadian and international, to read from and discuss their work with students and local audiences. In addition to readings, the series includes Master Classes and professional development activities, some open to the public and others only for Concordia students.The Mordecai Richler Reading Room is curated by the English department. The space is designed to inspire creative writers, spark fresh ideas among students, and foster original research from scholars.We use it as a gathering place for literary readings, master classes, cultural gatherings and short writing residencies. We will announce upcoming activities and events on the reading room's site.  
Concordia University is pleased to host Ann-Marie MacDonald as its first Richler Writer in Residence. A special feature of this residency is a series of digital dispatches by MacDonald in collaboration with The Walrus magazine.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityWriting at ConcordiaDepartment of English
