We try to offer opportunities to work closely as part of a research team to as many of our graduate students as possible, and through teaching assistantships, some students work closely with professors to further develop their professional skills.The Graduate Student Resource Center is a space dedicated exclusively to our graduate students, offering them a place to make and call their own.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGraduate programsDepartment of Education
