Objectives

The aim of the Science College is to prepare students enrolled in one of Concordia’s science programs for a life of research, teaching, or some similarly demanding intellectual pursuit in a profession. The academic program of the College complements the regular undergraduate curriculum and includes cross-disciplinary courses and student participation in laboratory research activities from the first year on. The collegial atmosphere fosters interaction among students and between students and faculty.
In Science College, students will gain an understanding of several areas of science, while specializing in whichever one they choose. Curricular structures frequently restrict students to a single discipline. To help counteract excessive specialization, the Science College has designed a series of courses to show what practising physicists think about physics; what mathematicians do when they are thinking mathematics: — not “an introduction to,” but “the state of the art.”

The College provides an opportunity for students to become acquainted with science as practised and understood by scientists today. Its curriculum is planned to fulfill the primary goals of the College — to provide an opportunity for experience in a research environment, for thinking about the nature of science, and for becoming aware of the style and content of the various scientific disciplines.
In Science College, students have the opportunity to work individually with active research scientists. This is done through a program of directed or independent study in each undergraduate year which enables them to undertake or participate in projects of discovery in a variety of different areas of scientific endeavour.
Students of the College will also be provided with an opportunity to consider the nature of science. The College offers courses in the intellectual and social context of science. Designed specifically for College students, these courses raise questions of broad interest to scientists and presume an understanding of the subject matter of science itself.
Students will also be given the opportunity to consider the social and cultural framework of their science studies through a basic course in some aspect of humanistic studies.
Finally, students will be encouraged to appreciate the link between clarity of thought and clarity of expression, through the availability of tutorial assistance in the development of writing skills.
Facilities

The College has study and lounge areas, computer facilities, a small library, and a few periodicals of general interest. The College offers students the opportunity and facilities to discuss matters of interest among themselves and with their professors. Science College also offers a number of courses and invites scientists to visit the University to meet College students.

Requirements for Admission to Science College
The program of Science College is academically demanding, involving concentration in one discipline and a critical investigation of other aspects of science. The College is committed to serious academic work and high standards, and seeks to attract talented and enthusiastic students who are willing to work hard in a search for a deeper understanding of their subject.
Students must enrol in a science program that leads to a BSc or BA (cognitive science) degree in order to be part of Science College. Students registered for a BA in Journalism are also eligible, as are students registered in the General Science Option of Computer Science.
In addition to the normal requirements for admission to the University’s various programs, applicants are expected to have a good academic average. They will be considered on the basis of their academic record, and a personal interview. Preference will be given to students who show a disposition and an aptitude to profit from the unique features of the sort of fundamental scientific education which the College offers. Applicants are encouraged to provide evidence of the range of their intellectual interests and of any creative activity in which they may have been involved.
Students must be prepared to attend courses at times outside the normal University schedule. The College is open to full-time students only.

Science College and Journalism
A limited number of students who have been admitted to the Major in Journalism program may be allowed to register in the Science College, with a view to combining a basic understanding of science with a training in journalism.

Performance Requirement
Students in the College must obtain a minimum grade of “B-” in all courses required for the Minor in Multidisciplinary Studies in Science, as well as in all courses counted toward their discipline-based honours, specialization, or major program. Students who receive a grade lower than “B-” are permitted to repeat the course. Students who receive a second grade lower than a “B-” are normally withdrawn from the minor.

Further Information
Further information on the courses and activities of the Science College may be obtained either by writing or by telephoning the College office. Personal interviews with a fellow of the Science College may be arranged through the Science College office.

Science College Curriculum
The College offers a Minor in Multidisciplinary Studies in Science, consisting of a core of courses which is required of all students. This core consists of 30 of the 90 credits normally required for a BSc degree. These courses have been developed specifically for the College with the intention of providing a unique, integrated program of education in science.
Program

In addition to completing the core curriculum, students are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements by completing a departmental honours, specialization, or major program leading to a BSc or BA (cognitive science).

Courses

Because of the renumbering of courses in the Department, students should see §200.1 for a list of equivalent courses.

SCOL 270     Historical, Philosophical, and Social Aspects of Science (6 credits)
Prerequisite: Membership in the Science College, or permission of the College. This course discusses the intellectual framework of science and the relationships between science and society, and the political and philosophical questions inherent in the scientific process. Students are expected to understand the scientific issues at the level at which they were originally addressed.

SCOL 290     Directed and Independent Study I (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Membership in the Science College, or permission of the College. The student works under the supervision of a member of the Faculty on either a practical laboratory project or a literature study. A formal, written report is required.

SCOL 350     Current Issues in Physical, Biological and Mathematical Sciences (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Membership in the Science College, or permission of the College. This course is designed to help students understand the “state of the art” in fields of science in which they are not specializing. It discusses problems under current study, and attempts to identify possible future directions of research. The approach is qualitative. Detailed technical knowledge is not prerequisite.

Specific topics for this course are stated in the Undergraduate Class Schedule.
