http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/strategic-directions/nine-directions/teach-for-tomorrow.htmlDeliver a next-generation education that’s connected, transformative, and fit for the times.Universities need to prepare students for a world that, in many ways, will be dramatically different from today’s.Providing a next-generation education means grounding students in the academic fundamentals while providing them with the kinds of skills and knowledge that will prepare them for the emerging demands of work, citizenship, and life.Urban research-engaged universities with faculty who are passionate about discovery and new ideas are especially well-placed to deliver this kind of education.Mandate: Devise strategies to spur further development of next-generation learning experiences at Concordia
Leader: M. Catherine Bolton, Vice-Provost, Teaching and Learning Read the cross-institutional strategy for Teach for Tomorrow.The vice-provost of Teaching and Learning convened a series of focus groups with faculty, staff, and students with a deep interest in next-generation learning.Additional input was sought from academic departments and individual faculty, staff, and students via a questionnaire and other online consultation methods.Note: The strategy builds on recommendations of multiple Strategic Directions Idea Groups, along with feedback from the Concordia community submitted during Phase 1 of the Strategic Directions process.directions@concordia.ca#CUdirections© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStrategic directions
