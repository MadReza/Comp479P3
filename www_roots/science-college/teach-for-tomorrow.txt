Leader: M. Catherine Bolton, Vice-Provost, Teaching and Learning Read the cross-institutional strategy for Teach for Tomorrow.The vice-provost of Teaching and Learning convened a series of focus groups with faculty, staff, and students with a deep interest in next-generation learning.Additional input was sought from academic departments and individual faculty, staff, and students via a questionnaire and other online consultation methods.Note: The strategy builds on recommendations of multiple Strategic Directions Idea Groups, along with feedback from the Concordia community submitted during Phase 1 of the Strategic Directions process.directions@concordia.ca#CUdirections© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStrategic directions
