It is a highly multidisciplinary field where new and unconventional approaches must often be integrated together to offer solutions beyond traditional methods. These solutions are met keeping in mind the laws of physics at all scales. The talk will show some examples of how future tiny intelligent robots envisioned by artists can now be a reality with the capability to navigate in the tiniest blood vessels and target hard-to-treat regions inside solid tumors.Dr. Sylvain Martel, Département de génie informatique et génie logiciel, École Polytechnique de Montréal© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
