The deadline is usually January 15.Note: We do not review late applications under any circumstances.The review begins. Our admissions process operates somewhat differently than that at other universities. Because our entire faculty makes a commitment to the student at admissions time, our admissions process provides the entire faculty an opportunity to participate in that decision. First, we prepare applications for reviewDuring this phase, the Program Administrator reviews all applications to make sure that they are complete, that grades meet minimum entry requirements, and that English proficiency tests (required for students educated outside of Canada, or who have not completed a bachelor’s or higher degree in English) meet minimum requirements.For degrees from academic systems outside of Canada, an assessment is made by an expert familiar with the equivalencies of different systems.Note: We do not waive either minimum grade or language requirements. Applications that do not meet minimum requirements are not sent for further review.Concordia University welcomes applicants from all parts of Canada, the United States and abroad. Find out everything about:During this phase, the Education Doctoral Committee (a committee that oversees the program) reviews applications to determine which ones to consider further.Issues considered include:During this phase, the faculty in the specializations within the Department of Education review applications to determine which candidates to interview. Faculty considers the same issues as the Education Doctoral Committee, as well as the likely match between applicants’ and faculty’s research interests.Members of the entire Department of Education (especially those in the area of specialization of the applicants) conduct brief (20-minute) interviews with candidates to learn more about their research interests, and to provide candidates with an opportunity to ask questions.The criteria for assessing the interview are the same as those used for the earlier assessment of the application.Based on the interview, the faculty determines as a group whether to admit the applicant. This ensures that the applicant has the support of the entire group, rather than just one or two faculty members.Afterwards, the group decides who will serve as interim supervisor and interim committee members. We do consider student preferences in making these assignments, but the faculty member the student suggested might not be available to serve or the faculty might be aware of an even better match that the student might not have considered.We only assign an interim supervisor and committee. Later in the program, when students qualify for the dissertation, they may choose their own supervisor and committee, basing their decisions on first-hand experience of having had worked with the faculty members.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityDepartment of Education
