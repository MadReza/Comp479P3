http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/program.htmlThe Science College offers highly motivated students in any of the sciences a multidisciplinary program that prepares you for a life of scientific thought and research. In this program — while majoring in your own discipline — you also participate in scientific research projects in each of your three undergraduate years. You’ll take courses that highlight the interrelated nature of the sciences, and you and other Science College students will wrestle with scientific problems, talk with professors and propose new ideas for discussion. This is a challenging program. Usually, Science College students appear as co-authors on papers based on their research.This minor is only available to students enrolled in the following programs (Specialization, Honours or Major):Students in the College must obtain a minimum grade of “B-” in all courses of their major, specialization or honours program and in all courses offered by the College. Please note that some courses may be repeated twice for credit in this program, provided the subject matter is different each time. Students are also expected to attend the presentations by fellows of the college at the coffee hour, Mondays 12 – 1 p.m.Minimum cut-off averages should be used as indicators. The cut-off data may change depending on the applicant pool. Applicants who meet the stated minimum requirements are not guaranteed admission to these programs.Make sure you also meet Concordia’s minimum admission requirements.The Minor in Multidisciplinary Studies in Science, consists of 30 of the 90 credits normally required for a BSc degree. These courses have been developed specifically for the College with the intention of providing a unique, integrated program of education in science. In addition to completing the core curriculum, students are responsible for satisfying their particular degree requirements by completing a departmental Honours, Specialization, or Major program leading to a BSc or BA (Psychology-cognitive science).Please consult the undergraduate calendar for a complete list of courses and program requirements.See current course offerings.© Concordia UniversityLoyola Campus
