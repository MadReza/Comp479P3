The Inclusive Journalism Project is a research initiative based at the Concordia Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism Studies whose goal is to work to change this. Thanks to support from donors to our crowd-funding campaign and The Concordian newspaper (theconcordian.com), we hired three students to produce and publish stories on poverty and homelessness. The stories were produced in collaboration with their subjects; the specific story topics emanated from what their subjects were interested in talking about and the story-telling style is dialogic.UQAM professor and CCBJS associate member Dr. Chantal Francoeur interviews Dr. Greg Nielsen, Dr. Mike Gasher, Matt D’Amours and Frank St-hilaire about the Inclusive Journalism Project.  See episode “Parler aux pauvres et non parler des pauvres”  http://www.choq.ca/emissions/formats-deconstruitsYou can read the stories here: ProjetJ websiteSearch for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityInclusive Journalism ProjectDepartment of Journalism
