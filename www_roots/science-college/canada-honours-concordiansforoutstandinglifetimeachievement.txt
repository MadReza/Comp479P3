The Order of Canada is second only to the Order of Merit when it comes to official recognition.Established in 1967, Canada’s centennial year, the Order recognizes outstanding achievement, dedication to the community and service to the nation.The Companion and Officer awards recognize lifetime achievement of the highest degree, especially in service to Canada or to humanity at large, while honourees in the the Member category are noted for service in a particular area.The Advisory Council for the Order of Canada, chaired by the chief justice and comprised of other prime-ranking officials, makes recommendations for the honours.The Governor General of Canada, currently the Right Honourable David Johnston, makes the ultimate decision, and on June 30, His Excellency announced 86 new appointments, three of whom hold honorary degress from Concordia.General A.
