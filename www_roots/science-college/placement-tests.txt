Researchers were interested in learning when students would approve the sacrifice of an animal to save the life of a human. The animal was a family pet, wild animal, or laboratory-raised animal. The person whose life would be saved ranged from a virtuous person (such as a loving husband and father of two children) to a bad person (such as a repeat sex offender).
 
 The acceptability of sacrificing an animal depended on the type of human who would be saved (lowest priority to the bad guys) and the type of animal to be sacrificed (lab rats were the least difficult to kill). The students were more willing to sacrifice an animal to save a good person than a neutral or bad person. Regardless of the type of person to be saved, however, they were less willing to sacrifice a pet than any other type of animal.  There were no differences in answer between the male and female students.
 
 Question:   Would you be willing to sacrifice an animal, even your pet, to save the life of a human being?"The purpose of the placement test is to determine the course that is best suited to your writing needs. You cannot pass or fail the test. Your essay is read holistically by two experienced Composition instructors and verified by the program coordinator. Readers assess the writing sample for the following: comprehension of the reading selection; length and development of the response; quality of idiomatic expression, including syntax, sentence structure, and vocabulary.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityPlacement testsDepartment of English
