http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/strategic-directions/nine-directions/go-beyond.htmlPush past the status quo and go the extra mile for members of our communityGo beyond is an overarching call to continuous improvement, fueled by imagination and pride.This call is applicable in every dimension of the university’s work, and across all roles. It urges us to think beyond what’s required to see what’s possible. It presses us to strive for best-in-class work, anticipating rather than reacting to fresh ways of thinking, changing needs, and evolving demands.And it means preparing for a future in which the status quo is unlikely to be sufficient, guided and tempered by a keen awareness of the legacy we leave behind. directions@concordia.ca#CUdirections© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStrategic directions
