She brings extensive research and administrative experience to the position, as well as a passion and enthusiasm for graduate education that's grounded in a clear understanding of the highly competitive global context in which we need to thrive.”Wood-Adams holds a PhD and MEng in Chemical Engineering from McGill University, and a BSc in the same field from the University of Alberta.

As an administrator she has provided effective strategic and operational direction to various functions of Graduate Studies, in particular focusing on curriculum and program development support, recruiting graduate students and improving the efficiency of the graduate awards process. She was also a member of the working group that developed Concordia’s current Academic Plan, which strongly emphasizes the advancement of research and graduate studies.Wood-Adams has contributed to numerous articles in well-recognized peer-reviewed scientific journals in the areas of polymer science and rheology, and has received more than $2.5 million in individual and shared grants from federal, Quebec and private funding agencies as well as several fellowships to advance her research. She has also supervised or co-supervised more than 25 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and continues to lead an active group of research students.
