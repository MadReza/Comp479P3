We have a computer lab, kitchen, nursery and a lounge for you to use.This is the area where student parents have access to computers, the baby nursery, and the lounge where they can relax, study and enjoy a coffee and snacks.  As our lounge is designed for both student parents and their children, you can use your laptop or our shared desktop computer while your children play or relax. The play area is equipped with toys, books, and games, a conference table for arts and crafts as well as a corner to watch movies - all available in a child-friendly environment.  CUSP parents are welcome to use our fridge and microwave. A lending library with a small collection of books which address parenting issues is available – just ask a CUSP employee if you want to borrow a book!(514) 848-2424, ext. 2431
