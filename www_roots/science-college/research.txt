These research projects allow students to acquire first-hand scientific experience. The research may be carried out with scientists at Concordia or at some other university or research institution. In recent years, students have completed projects at universities like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Rochester, Frankfurt, Freiberg, Paris, Berlin, Innsbruck, San Diego, Johns Hopkins, London University, England, Simon Fraser University, Barbados, Miami and others. The work of the student is supervised and graded either by a faculty member or by an academically qualified person at the outside institution. An attractive aspect of this program is that students are expected to participate in research projects outside their field. One can find a physics student doing experiments in neurophysiology, or a biology student participating in a computer project. This program is the core of our curriculum and is unique in Canada. Students are not just doing laboratory exercises. They are active and interested participants in the resolution of current scientific problems. This role both sharpens their understanding of science and gives them first-hand experience with what to expect from a scientific career. It has been our experience that the most interested and motivated students would rather do the research than view it from a distance.The college has its own library.© Concordia UniversityLoyola Campus

They are well known for their strong research profiles that inform their teaching and afford graduate students the opportunity to work on cutting edge research. A healthy level of external research funding enables faculty members to provide financial assistance to many qualified students.COPAL is a refereed journal of local and international scope, dedicated to the publication of a wide range of ongoing research by students and faculty in the fields of TESOL and Applied Linguistics (including first and second language acquisition, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics). Each volume consists of two issues, published in the summer and winter of every year.Established in 1988 and based at Concordia University, the Centre for the Study of Learning and Performance (CSLP) is a research centre consisting of over 50 principal members from 10 different research institutions.  The CSLP has led a variety of innovative research and development projects, involving hundreds of students from elementary, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions.ALERT is team of applied linguists working within the CSLP.  The ALERT project applies an innovative multi-dimensional approach to understanding and enhancing language learning. The multi-dimensional approach refers to an analysis of grammatical (morphosyntactic), lexical, and phonological aspects of a learning problem with a specific focus on the interactions between these aspects.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityResearchDepartment of Education
