http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/program/courses.htmlThe Science College's unique program complements the student's standard science curriculum by offering a wide variety of cross-disciplinary courses designed especially for Science College students. Physics students, for example, may be required to learn about the biological effects of radiation or about the physiology of vision. Biology students may be required to learn about radiation in the solar system or about the mathematical concepts of symmetry. Such courses are not part of the regular science curriculum and are not offered by traditional science departments. We know, however, that the fast-changing nature of contemporary scientific research does not respect the traditional boundaries between disciplines.See the Undergraduate Calendar for course descriptionsPlease note that students take SCOL 290, SCOL 390 and SCOL 490 every semester.Science College:
