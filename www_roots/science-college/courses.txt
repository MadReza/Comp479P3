http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/english/programs/courses.htmlUndergraduate and graduate courses for English literature and creative writing students, as well as advice and resources for current students.
The study of literature written in English is the largest component of the English Department. Our courses will develop skills in critical thinking, rhetorical analysis, and a sense of writing as being central to the "knowledge economy."  
Our graduate programs deepen and extend your comprehensive background in English literature at a more advanced and exacting scholarly and professional level, and develop in you a measure of specialization in a particular area within the discipline of English literary studies.Students are welcome to arrange an appointment for academic advising at any point in their studies at Concordia for reasons as diverse as confirming course choice, understanding requirements, program changes, student requests, or more generally, information about services available to students at Concordia.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCourses & advisingDepartment of English
