http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/about/strategic-directions/archives/advisory-committee.htmlMembers of the Strategic Directions Advisory Committee include the Senate Steering Committee and Academic Planning and Priorities Committee as well as additional students, researchers, faculty and staff. Seven Idea Groups were created by the Advisory Committee to focus on key strategic issues as we chart the future of Concordia. These groups consulted with members of our community, initiated conversations, and gleaned some of the most promising ideas for what’s next at Concordia.Benoit-Antoine Bacon, Provost and VP, Academic Affairs, and Graham Carr, VP of Research and Graduate Studies, reflect and pose key questions to explore during the strategic directions process. I am convinced that Concordia is on the right path as a next-generation university, and that our model of education (urban, diverse, research engaged, and embedded within our community) will really come of age in the 21st century.Over the last 10 years, we have grown tremendously at all levels: student population, faculty complement, research capacity, footprint etc. We have developed a wide array of strengths in both traditional and more innovative aspects of teaching, research and student experience. Our reputation has soared and will continue to do so.The current strategic directions process needs to build on our history and tradition, but must also recognize and carefully take into account the serious and profound transformations that the higher education is currently undergoing. We must take the broad and holistic view.Strategy is a pattern in a stream of decisions (H. Mintzberg). Our strategic directions process is not about making all the decisions today, but about establishing principles and aspirations that will help to create a meaningful and fruitful pattern over the next few years.The world is changing very fast. Successful, next-generation universities will recognize that reality, embrace it and work creatively to capitalize on new opportunities to shape their future.Strategic planning begins with a conversation about positioning, differentiation and relevance. But the conversation lives or dies when it turns to having the appetite, will or vision to experiment and implement creative change intelligently.In research, for example, the problems that matter to society transcend all sorts of boundaries — political, geographic, institutional, sectoral and disciplinary. As we plan our future, the conversation we need to have is not just about how to adapt our existing spaces, structures, and programs to address new challenges, but also how to create new hubs and catalysts that position us to exploit emerging technologies, ignite new thinking, and become leaders in tackling grand challenges on a grand scale.If Concordia is to be an important, innovative force in tomorrow's world, producing audacious talent for the 21st century-knowledge society, how do we imagine or create new graduate or multi-cycle programs that train students to world-class standards of expertise, but also offer them new experiences, open different horizons of perspective, and diversify the pathways to professional opportunity?And last but not least, how do we position ourselves in a global context, by fostering mobility for students, faculty and ideas, by connecting our research and graduate studies to an ever-widening universe of imagination, possibility and action?  Ali Akgunduz
