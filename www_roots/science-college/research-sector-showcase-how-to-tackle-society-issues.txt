“To double our research, Concordia is looking at new ways to collaborate both within and outside the university walls,” says Justin Powlowski, interim vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies.Some of that work will be on full view November 23, when the university’s senate-recognized units, centres and institutes come together for the second annual Research Sector Showcase in the atrium of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Complex (EV).From preventive health to digital arts to nanocomposites, Concordia researchers affiliated with these entities will demonstrate how they’re addressing societal challenges, using interactive presentations, photographic collections and scientific displays.Joining more than 20 research units are representatives from the PERFORM Centre and the Leonard and Bina Ellen Art Gallery — all of which fall under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies.Powlowski notes that events like the showcase help the university meet its goal of stimulating increased research activity and impact.“We want to share what we know and make people think about how the new knowledge our research generates impacts them and how it makes a difference in a rapidly changing world.”Powlowski emphasizes that Concordia researchers and research units contribute to the university’s Double Our Research strategic direction in many ways.“It’s about much more than just funding. University faculty members and students double their impact by teaming up with other researchers to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams and by combining efforts with industry or community partners to tackle real-world problems and challenges.  One of the major ways is through the platforms, units and centres that will be on display at this event.”
Attend the Research Sector Showcase on Wednesday, November 23, from 2 to 4 p.m.
