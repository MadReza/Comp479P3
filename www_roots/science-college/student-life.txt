http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/science-college/student-life.htmlAttending Science College means you'll immerse yourself in science: conduct independent research throughout your undergraduate program, attend lunch-hour presentations on hot topics and reflect on the historical, philosophical and social aspects of science.Science College has participated in this showcase of scientific activity at Concordia University for many years. It is frequented by many high school and CEGEP students and younger children with their parents. The students, faculty and staff who meet with the public on a one-to-one basis are an excellent demonstration of the quality of our institution. The event is one of the best ways to recruit students and to instill an interest in science, engineering and technology. The public has an opportunity to discuss their interests with the students who have already made a commitment to Concordia. The fair is held annually in November at Stewart Hall, in the Pointe-Claire Cultural Centre.We support the Hydro-Quebec Science Expo and offer small prizes for winning contestants.Contact us to learn how to participate.© Concordia UniversityLoyola Campus
