It will direct you to print your Certificate. Once you have printed your Certificate, you can present it to one of the participating financial institutions in order to complete the loan process. Certificates of Guarantee for students borrowing through AFE’s part time student loan program will continue to be sent in paper format to the university.For more information, please contact Aide financière aux études directly. You can also contact the Financial Aid and Awards Office. We are here to help you. As a graduate or undergraduate student who is a permanent resident or Canadian citizen, find out if you are eligible for government student aid in your respective province or through the federal government. We work with you and your parents to determine your eligibility for different types of loans based on US federal guidelines. Contact usFinancial Aid & Awards Office© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGovernment student aidStudent hub
