Concordia is quickly moving forward with the Curriculum Innovation Fund (CIF).This university-wide initiative supports faculty in their explorations of course and program transformation with the aim of providing Concordia students with dynamic, engaging learning experiences.On May 1, the project’s leaders and participants came together to celebrate 22 successful CIF proposals.Following a soft launch in the fall, 11 projects — including eight courses and three programs — were approved. The first official call for proposals concluded in March; now 11 more projects are receiving support from the fund.Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, is proud of the program, as it supports faculty as they bring their best classroom ideas to life.“We received a really strong mix of applications in these first two rounds, with everything from suggestions for new programs from the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science to a trans-faculty initiative from Fine Arts and Arts and Science, in the form of a community-centred project in Montreal’s southwest,” he told a crowd of more than 50 great invitees, including CIF recipients, deans and departmental chairs at a special event on May 1.The CIF’s 22 proposals span the academic spectrum.Catherine Bolton, vice-provost of Teaching and Learning, says they are precisely the sort of project the fund — part of Concordia’s Academic Plan — was created to support. “The post-secondary landscape is in a process of great change right now. We want to respond to it so we can position our students ahead of the curve.”

To that end, the fund has accepted projects that fall under four overarching themes: blended/online learning, multidisciplinarity, sustainability, and community engagement.Stephen Yeager, an assistant professor in the Department of English, is developing an online and in-class course that examines Old English through the lens of fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien.“I'm hoping that the Tolkien angle will encourage students to study the language, because it's really cool, really fun and really interesting. And it will help them understand Tolkien a lot better,” Yeager said.At the John Molson School of Business, the Department of Management is introducing an MBA class designed to explore sustainability issues faced by businesses.

“We have chosen to integrate sustainability into our MBA program directly by bringing students to organizations and leaders that are wrestling with it every day to make a difference,” said Associate Professor Raymond Paquin.In a multidisciplinary project pitched by Kathleen Vaughan, an associate professor in the Department of Art Education, Concordia’s “Studio Inquiry” course will be transformed into what she describes “an intensive, dynamic exploration of contemporary creative and pedagogical practices, with a recognized and innovative visiting artist as course instructor.”The Department of Journalism, meanwhile, has highlighted community engagement by rethinking its long-standing graduate diploma to fit the demands of modern-day news publishing.Associate Professor Lisa Lynch explained that it will evolve “from a skills-focused vocational program into a ‘global journalism’ program designed to fit a changing demographic of students and the changing needs of the profession.”Bacon believes that the CIF’s 22 projects are contributing to a bright future at Concordia — and beyond.

“We are very happy to be able to recognize and support the care and attention that you have brought to our students, so that their education and experience at Concordia is one that will stay with them for the rest of their lives,” he told the project leaders. “We can’t wait to hear about the results of your classes and programs next year.” The Curriculum Innovation Fund has two tracks: course transformation and program transformation. Learn more about the CIF.So far, 22 proposals have received the CIF’s support.
