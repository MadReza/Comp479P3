http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/english/programs/undergraduate/english-literature.htmlThe study of literature written in English is the largest component of the English Department. Students develop skills in critical thinking, rhetorical analysis, and writing that are central to the "knowledge economy." Our students have gone on to careers in teaching, law, journalism, business, and advertising.Students in the literature programs encounter the literatures of Great Britain and Ireland, Canada, the United States, and world literature written in English. They can also develop an interest in literary theory and models of literary interpretation relevant to fields such as philosophy, history, and anthropology.The department regularly invites guest speakers. The annual Lahey Lecture features a speaker of international significance for literary studies. C.A.S.E. (Concordia Association for Students of English) also regularly sponsors events for undergraduates in the literature programs.You may complete a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature at three levels:
