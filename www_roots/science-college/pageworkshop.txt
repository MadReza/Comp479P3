The weak recovery since the 2008 global financial crisis has caught many policy makers off guard. In spite of record low interest rates, businesses are not increasing investment in Canada. Our major labour market indicators have not returned to pre-recession levels. Youth unemployment rates remain high just as Canada faces a major aging demographic transition. And the new government continues to struggle to make policy decisions that fall in line with campaign promises while also remaining transparent on such decisions.What short and long term strategies are Canada and other countries using to restore growth? Is it time to consider other policy options? What must this government do to ensure fiscal policy that will secure a prosperous future for all Canadians?On April 7th, 2017, join Kevin Page, Canada's first Parliamentary Budget Officer, to find out!Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
