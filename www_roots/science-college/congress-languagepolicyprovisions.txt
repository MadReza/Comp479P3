http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/events/conferences/acfas-en/congress-languagepolicyprovisions.htmlOn the occasion of the annual congress, Acfas will ensure that the authors of scientific communications respect the language policy while at the same time facilitating involvement by researchers of the host institution. Presentations are to be made in French, whether they are part of a colloquium or a general session (both oral and poster presentations.) Exceptionally, Acfas will allow some communications to take place in a language other than French for participants involved in a colloquium. These presentations must, however, be supported by a printed PowerPoint presentation in French distributed to those present or arrangements must be made to have an interpreter in the room (all translation and interpreter charge will be borne by the person responsible for the colloquium or by the principal colloquium presenter.) Those responsible for the colloquium must make arrangements with Acfas personnel beforehand. Please consult Acfas’s general policy governing the use of French© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCongress Language Policy ProvisionsEvents

                All colloquium and general session papers must be submitted in French. Exceptionally, colloquium proposals may be submitted to the congress scientific committee in English as long as the fields « 1 – Titre/Title » and « 3 – Thème/Theme » (or résumé/abstract) of the form are completed in French when the proposal is submitted.All titles and abstracts of scientific papers will be published in French in the congress program.The associated universities appearing in the program will be identified in keeping with the norms established by the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada for all Canadian congress participants. The name of other universities will be rendered in the official language of the countries for foreign participants if they do not have an official French name (for example, Bülent Ecevit University, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul.) When Acfas or the scientific committee is informed that a presentation will be made in a language other than French, Acfas personnel will ensure that the person responsible for that colloquium be accessible for unilingual francophones. Acfas 2014Welcome messagesAbout AcfasCommitteesVolunteersCongress Language Policy ProvisionsSustainabilityAboutAcademicsAdmissionsCampus lifeResearchInternationalFuture studentsCurrent studentsAlumni & friendsParents Faculty & stafffacebooktwittergoogleyoutubelinkedinpinterestinstagramflickr© Concordia UniversityTermsPrivacyAccessibilityWebsite feedback
