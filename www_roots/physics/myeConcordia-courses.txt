EV 12.163Taking on an existing course and molding it to fit your approach is always a challenge. But how do you take on a virtual course based on someone else's video lessons? This session will allow you to discuss strategies for making existing material your own.Penny Ellison

EV 6.735Taking a course on-line can offer wonderful flexibility, but can also leave students feeling isolated. One way to breakdown this barrier is to offer regular on-line tutorials using the Adobe Connect software. The tutorial can be designed to provide guidance and instruction, but also to elicit student participation and questions. It's an important tool in creating a classroom-type experience for on-line courses.Bill Reimer

EV 12.163The role of TAs is dramatically altered in the day-to-day activities of an on-line course. Instead of supporting the instructor in the classroom, TAs provide the primary points of contact with students. A greater proportion of the instructor load shifts to TA support. In this session we will explore some of the implications of this change: from techniques to manage the changing demands and the reorganization of pedagogy required to the re-evaluation of contract demands.Download the presentationRobert Hopp

EV 12.163One of the challenges I faced when designing an online introductory computer programming course was finding a way for students to interact with the more challenging concepts in the course. My solution was via interactive Java applets where computer program segments where specified in the conventional, textual manner, and graphics where used to visualize the execution of the segment via interactive simulations. The tool was designed to allow students to control the activation of the scaffolding feature at will to best meet their individual learning needs. During this 30 minute session, I will demonstrate how a student would interact with one of the applets and explain the pedagogical rationale behind its design.Frances Shaver

EV 6.735This presentation focuses on two key challenges when teaching Sex Work and Society, a course is grounded, in part, in current and controversial public debates. Because the debates are current, new knowledge/evidence is emerging; because they are controversial, student engagement should include an awareness of their colleagues’ opinions. I partially address the challenge of student engagement by using weekly opinion polls linked to the lectures and the discussion boards. However, I am looking for suggestions on how to incorporate current and ongoing debates into the lectures, videos, and assignments while minimizing updates to the site, especially those that involve members of the eConcordia production team.Visit the tables and kiosks of service providers in innovation, learning platforms, software, services and more to get tips and info on some of the latest technologies for teaching and learning.10 a.m. - 2 p.m.
