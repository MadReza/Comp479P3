A fan of the games, Montreal-based Usheroff is a producer, cinematographer and co-founder of Black Box Productions. “I’ll spend 10 days in Sochi attending events and capturing my experience in tweets, photos and short videos,” says Usheroff.The Concordia grad is one of two winners of Samsung Canada's Mobilers contest. The electronics giant paid his way, provided tickets to events and a new Galaxy Note 3 phone.“Samsung staff are in Sochi organizing activities for us and helping us plan our daily content. I’ll be blogging about the various events to bring home the Olympic experience to everyone who couldn’t attend the games themselves,” says Usheroff.“Contestants submitted short videos explaining why they would be the ideal candidate to go to Sochi. After a period of online voting and an interview process, I was selected."What is a Canadian to do in Russia, where over 2,800 athletes will compete in 98 sporting events over the course of two weeks?Try to meet the talent: “It would be awesome to meet Montreal Canadiens players PK Subban and Carey Price, both of whom are playing hockey for Team Canada,” says Usheroff.“There were a handful of athletes on the plane heading to Sochi. I’ve also met athletes leading up to the games. In the fall, I was the cinematographer of a speed skating commercial featuring Canadian Olympic athletes Michael Gilday and Marie-Eve Drolet.”See the sites: “I’m an avid skier, so when I’m not attending an event, I might try to sneak in some skiing on the Russian slopes. I’ll take time to explore the various coastal and mountain sites in the area,” says Usheroff.To communicate his message to Canadians, Usheroff will draw on skills he acquired at Concordia.“One of the great takeaways from my time in Communication Studies was considering how to create meaning and connect with the audience,” says Usheroff.Follow Usheroff’s adventures in Sochi on Twitter and Instagram (@SochiJosh2014).Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityConcordian wins front seat to Sochi GamesNews
