http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/coms/programs/communication-studies-phd.htmlConcordia University has one of the best doctoral programs in communication studies in the country and an international reputation for excellence in research and teaching.  Founded in 1987, as a radically innovative experiment in inter-university collaboration, the program has continued to evolve over the past thirty years as new faculty have joined the program.Our department possesses a rich and vibrant research culture, comprising numerous nationally and internationally reputed, award-winning scholars, artists, and film-makers, with extensive track records in graduate supervision, research training, and mentoring (for further information about individual faculty areas of expertise and ongoing research projects, please consult the department’s individual faculty pages). Some of our department’s particular areas of research and teaching strength include: cultural studies; feminist media studies; research-creation; media history; digital culture; visual culture; sound studies; and games studies.  Our approach to communication studies traverses the humanities, social sciences, and media arts, and several members of the department conduct research at the crossroads of science and the humanities.  Broadly speaking, our department supports research and graduate study in the forms and formats of communication technologies; in the meaning-making aspects of communications; in issues of power and politics; and finally, in the emancipatory potential of communications for diverse constituents and communities. For a sense of the range of topics addressed by PhD students in our department, see our list of theses completed.In addition to their coursework and doctoral projects, students in the PhD in Communication program are given opportunities to teach courses in our department, to present their work at local, national, and international conferences, and to participate in the ongoing activities of numerous research centres based at Concordia, including: Fluxmedia, ARC, the Mobile Media Lab, TAG, Hexagram, the Media History Research Centre, the Centre for Sensory Studies, the Screen Culture Research Group, and ARTHEMIS.The intellectual energy of our PhD. students is a constant source of inspiration. Over the years, students have organized ground-breaking conferences (including a highly successful biennial conference run by students in the Joint Program), established reading and thesis support groups, and instigated numerous social events. Our students have also been successful in securing highly competitive scholarships and awards, including the Trudeau Scholarship and the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship. Graduates from our program have gone on to take up post-doctoral fellowships, employment in the public and private sectors, and academic positions across Canada and around the world.Concordia’s PhD in Communication is offered under the rubric of a Joint PhD program that combines the talents of professors, students and staff from three institutions: Concordia University; the University of Montreal; and the University of Quebec at Montreal.  Students in our program are encouraged to take advantage of these expanded resources in their selection of courses and in the composition of their committees, and more generally, to benefit from the fertile research and media arts environment that makes Montreal the leading destination for Communication Studies in Canada.A PhD is a serious, long-term undertaking, and so you must research potential graduate schools carefully. I hope that in the process, you discover that Concordia’s PhD in Communication is the right program for you, and in that case, we look forward to receiving your application.  If you have any questions about the program or the application process, you are most welcome to contact me.Sincerely,Dr. Yasmin Jiwani
