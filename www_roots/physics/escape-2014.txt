More information on the presenters and relevant documentation may be found under each day's tab. Content will be made available throughout the month of March 2014: please visit often!e.Scape 2014 focuses specifically on online courses and developing  a planned approach to online development. Concordia has developed and continues to develop individual online courses, but these have been created one by one. While this has given our students some fascinating courses, it is time to think more globally about where e-learning fits in our graduate and undergraduate curriculum. We plan programs and curricula for our future students and the anticipated academic direction of our programs. Online learning should be a part of this planning process. We hope to encourage faculty members and departments to think more strategically about the place of e-learning in their programs. We hope that faculty members will come and listen to their colleagues and find out that the online environment can be a challenging and productive learning space for their students.Provost and Vice-President, Concordia University6 - 6:10 p.m.

EV 2.260 (Norman D. Hébert Conference Room)Open to the publicOnline learning is no longer a peripheral activity but goes now to the heart of university teaching, as it becomes increasingly integrated with classroom learning. This raises questions such as how to decide what should be done online and what in class, what kind of student benefits most from online learning, and what kinds of learning outcomes should we be teaching for in a digital society. This presentation looks at the reasons for change, and suggests practical steps that faculty can take to ensure that students are best prepared for a digital world within their particular subject domain.We gratefully acknowledge the support of KnowledgeOne for this event.Download the presentation© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityEvents
