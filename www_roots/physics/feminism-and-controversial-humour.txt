http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/cissc/working-groups/feminism-and-controversial-humour.htmlWhy is humour often so divisive? When and how are jokes about difficult or traumatic experiences productive and healing? Beginning with the assumption that humour can invite meaningful, pleasurable engagements with issues of privilege, power and difference, our group explores the possibilities and potential pitfalls of using humour in feminist teaching and performance and considers how established theories of laughter and comedy can contribute to an interdisciplinary feminist analysis of humour about violence and racial, ethnic, religious, gender, and sexual difference. OrganizersDanielle Bobker, Associate Professor, EnglishGada Mahrouse, Associate Professor, Simone de Beauvoir InstituteEmer O’Toole, Assistant Professor, Irish StudiesDanielle Bobker, Associate Professor, EnglishGada Mahrouse, Associate Professor, Simone de Beauvoir InstituteEmer O’Toole, Assistant Professor, Irish StudiesSusan Cahill, Associate Professor, Irish Studies, ConcordiaDesirée de Jesus, PhD candidate, Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, ConcordiaAlyson Grant, Instructor, English Department, Dawson College, PlaywrightKirsten Humbert, ComedianAlexa Martin-Storey, Associate Professor, Département de psychoéducation, SherbrookeSina Queyras, Senior Lecturer, Creative Writing, Director of Writers Read, English, ConcordiaIan Reilly, Associate Researcher at ACT, Communication Studies, ConcordiaCarrie Rentschler, Associate Professor and William Dawson Scholar of Feminist Media Studies, Department of Art History and Communication Studies, McGillSamantha Thrift, Instructor, Communication, Media and Film, University of CalgaryNatalie Willet, Montreal Comedian, Founder and host of Open MichelleAll faculty and graduate students are welcome to attend.
