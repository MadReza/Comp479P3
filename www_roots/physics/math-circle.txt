http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/math-stats/2016/12/04/math-circle.htmlThe Montreal math circle is an enrichment program which offers an occasion for students interested in mathematics to solve challenging problems at their grade level. The circle aims at bringing pleasure and confidence in children while doing mathematics. The problems during each meeting will be centered around a specific topic. The instructor is bilingual and will accommodate students from both English and French instruction schools. For more information, please feel free to send an email at montrealmathclub@gmail.com.

The math circle resumed its second year of activities, offering two sessions of six topics each.  The first session runs from October 2 until November 6, and the second session from November 13 until December 18. If you would like to register your child for a session, please complete the form http://goo.gl/forms/Wji4AjIkGU.

This can be paid to the instructor at the time of the first meeting, in cash or by check (payable to: Institut des sciences mathématiques). The Montreal math circle reserves its right to cancel a certain level if a minimum of 6 participants is not attained.Parents of children attending the circle are asked to complete the following form and bring it to the instructor at the beginning of the session: http://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/docs/policies/official-policies/VPS-8_waiver.pdfPlease note: We reserve the right to take photographs during our outreach activities or events and use them for promotional purposes.
