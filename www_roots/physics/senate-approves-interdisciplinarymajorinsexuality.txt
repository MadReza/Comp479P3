http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2014/02/18/senate-approves-interdisciplinarymajorinsexuality.htmlAt its February 14 meeting, Senate approved a new Major in Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality, proposed by the Simone de Beauvoir Institute in collaboration with the Faculty of Fine Arts.The aim of the new program is to “foster students’ understanding of the role of sexuality in society and behaviour, and encourage recognition of sexual culture, social organization and identity in all aspects of our world.”The new 42-credit program will prepare students for a variety of different careers in artistic and cultural creation, or for positions in community, cultural or non-governmental organizations. It will also provide a foundation for them to pursue graduate work in queer or gender studies.The program must now be approved by the Bureau de coopération interuniversitaire (formerly CREPUQ) and the Ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche, de la Science et de la Technologie (MESRST).In his regular progress update on Concordia’s Academic Plan, Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, announced that the university has recommitted funding to support the unique and increasingly popular Graduate and Professional Skills training program (GradProSkills).Since January, 1,250 graduate students have registered for GradProSkills workshops. The program will receive $450,000 for 2014-15, drawn from a special “insertion professionelle” envelope of funds provided by the Government of Quebec to help prepare students to find employment after university.Bacon reminded Senators about the second call for proposals for the Curriculum Innovation Fund. The deadline is March 17. Read more.He also praised the success of the recent Teaching and Learning Winter Festival, and reminded the community of the upcoming e.SCAPE conference.

The panel, consisting of 11 scholars from Canada, the U.S. and Europe, was tasked with preparing a report on the status and future of libraries and archives in Canada. As part of the process, 15 consultation sessions were held across Canada, beginning in May 2013. The final report will be available next fall.One concern to many Canadians is the recent closure of seven of 11 fisheries libraries by the federal government. “We are interested in reading about cases where reduction in library and archive services infringes research activities,” said Beaudry, who encouraged Senators to share their experiences about the availability of library and archives resources with the Royal Society.
