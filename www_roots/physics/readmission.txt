Supporting documentation (doctor's note, death certificate, etc.) must be submitted with the application with an updated transcript. Students will be informed, in writing, of all necessary steps to apply for readmission.must wait out at least three years before applying for readmission. Students in this situation must contact Student Academic Services at extension 2104 and make an appointment with an Academic Counsellor. At this appointment, it will be determined if the student is eligible for readmission. It is only with the Academic Counsellor's permission that a student in the academic situation can apply for readmission.The deadline to submit the application for readmission is normally June 30th of every year. The exact deadline for the current year is specified on the application.
