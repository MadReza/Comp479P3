She also negotiated large-scale continuing education contracts with the Ordre des travailleurs sociaux et thérapeutes conjugaux et familiaux du Québec, among many others.At Université de Sherbrooke, Dunnigan managed a team of academic professionals and administrative assistants, and oversaw the work of almost 70 instructors and corporate continuing-education partners.“I’m very excited to join Concordia,” she says. “This is a superb opportunity to build on the Centre for Continuing Education’s excellent reputation and to scale up its activities. I look forward to working in close collaboration with the members of the centre and with the senior university leaders to advance the centre’s and the university’s academic mission.”Dunnigan has a Master of Science in Finance and a Bachelor of Business Administration from Université de Sherbrooke.As chair of the advisory search committee, Benoit-Antoine Bacon extends his sincere thanks to the committee members — Catherine Bolton, John Dickson, Brenda Grant, Carol Hawthorne-Laliberté, Lisa Ostiguy, Adrianne Sklar and Marylee Wholey — for their expertise and collaborative work in identifying Dunnigan’s exceptional fit for the position of director of Continuing Education.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityIsabel Dunnigan assumes a pivotal role as the new director of Concordia’s Centre for Continuing EducationNews
