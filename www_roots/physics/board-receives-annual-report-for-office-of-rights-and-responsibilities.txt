Campus Solutions replaces a 32-year-old legacy system and supports virtually all student-related services, processes and business functions at the university.As with any implementation of a new system of this size and scope, Shepard said there have been modest technical glitches and the SIS team continues to work digilently to address issues as they arise and to offer training sessions. A group of student peer helpers, called the SIS HELP brigade, is also helping students navigate the new system and answer students’ questions.Work progresses on the strategic directions initiatives, which includes the speaker series, The Future of the University and the Future of Learning. Upcoming presenters include Elizabeth Cannon, president of the University of Calgary, who addresses the question, “How can universities go from good to great?”  Idea Cafés are being held to engage faculty, staff and students in conversations about Concordia’s future. Idea Groups are also meeting to focus on seven key strategic issues.Following the retirement of Craig Buchanan, the Board approved the appointment of Frederica Martin as the administrative and support staff representative to the Appeals Committee, Governance and Ethics Committee and Human Resources Committee.MedSpecs Concordia, Concordia Veterans Association and Hip Hop Heads Concordia received Board approval to use Concordia in their names.The non-profit student-run club MedSpecs assists students throughout their application process to medical school. Concordia Veterans Association supports the reintegration of Concordia student veterans of all nationalities and undertakes efforts to educate students about mental health and military issues. The mandate of Hip Hop Heads Concordia is to create awareness of all elements of hip hop and provide a platform for aspiring rappers, dancers, artists and DJs.Louise Shiller, director and senior advisor for the Office of Rights and Responsibilities (ORR), presented a summary of the 2013-14 annual report. The office administers the Code of Rights and Responsibilities, which sets standards of conduct for all university members (students, faculty and staff).Additional policies used or administered by ORR include the Protocol on the Coordination of Urgent Cases of Threatening or Violent Conduct, Policy on Student Involuntary Leave of Absence (POSILA) and the Policy On Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Psychological Harassment.In 2013-14, consultations accounted for 50 per cent of services, corresponding with the office’s philosophy of prevention and early intervention. Shiller said informal resolution continues to be the preferred approach, when appropriate, to address conflict. Of the 317 requests for assistance, 42 per cent were cases (informal, formal and POSILA-related), with the majority being dealt with informally. Twenty-five formal complaints were processed.Roger Côté, vice-president of Services, noted the 2014 Environmental Health and Safety compliance report includes a new dashboard for measuring the university’s health and safety performance.This dashboard now includes two sets of performance indicators: leading safety indicators — ones that measure safety performance and reflect the safety culture such as safety training and inspections — and lagging indicators — more traditonal indicators that focus on situations after they have occurred such as injuries.
