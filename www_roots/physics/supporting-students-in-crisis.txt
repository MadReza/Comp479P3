http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2011/06/21/supporting-students-in-crisis.htmlConcordia has adopted a policy on circumstances and procedures surrounding involuntary leave for students.“The goal of this policy is to provide support to students who are in crisis situations, generally involving their physical or mental health, and to help them eventually return to their studies,” explains Vice-President Services Roger Côté. “This is a policy for extraordinary situations when the university must react on behalf of a student in distress. We have established clear guidelines that respect the privacy of students in these situations and that allow the university to assess the situation, make decisions and act appropriately.”

Students may be required to take an involuntary leave of absence if their behaviour, mental health or physical health interferes with their academic pursuits or those of others, or interferes with the regular activities of the university. The policy stresses that such measures are intended to be supportive and should not be considered disciplinary.

The policy also outlines the responsibilities of the case team, composed of representatives from Health Services, Counselling and Development, and Advocacy and Support Services, which will evaluate each situation.

Where a student has received approval to return to campus following a leave of absence, the Advisor on Rights and Responsibilities, along with the case team, prepares a plan that outlines any terms and conditions of the student’s return to campus and any support services required. They will also monitor the student’s transition back to campus.

The policy came into effect March 15, 2011.
