Senate also approved a new graduate diploma in Visual Journalism, proposed by Concordia’s Department of Journalism.The 33-credit program is aimed at students seeking a career in either photojournalism or video journalism, and working journalists who want to supplement their existing professional skills to be able to develop stories across different news platforms.As explained in the program summary, much of the demand in today’s journalism job market is for polyvalent professionals capable of producing stories for text, video, audio and online media.New courses include: digital imaging, visual storytelling, news and feature photography, lighting, photo editing, and computer-assisted reporting. “The department believes this program will be an attractive addition to our current journalism offerings and importantly fills a void in university-level journalism education in Canada,” said Brian Gabrial, chair of the Department of Journalism.Read more.Senate approved revisions to the curriculum of the current Graduate Diploma in Chartered Accountancy (CA) Program in the JMSB, and renamed it the Graduate Diploma in Chartered Professional Accountancy (CPA). Before the three professional orders for accountants were united under the CPA designation, accounting students followed one of three separate educational paths: chartered accountant (CA), certified management accountant (CMA) and certified general accountant (CGA).Read more.In his regular update on Concordia’s Academic Plan, Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and vice-president of academic affairs, announced that the university’s Research Committee is finalizing the review process for the current round of strategic faculty hires.
