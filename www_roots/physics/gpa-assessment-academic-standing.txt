http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/students/gpa-assessment-academic-standing.htmlAcademic performance is assessed using a GPA calculation. This is done once a year and determines your academic standing for that year, at the university.Students have two GPAs:As of Fall 2012, in order to be able to graduate, students must have both a last annual and a cumulative GPA of at least a 2.00.The term GPA shows your academic performance for the particular term.An assessment of your academic standing is done once a year after winter grades have been submitted. If you attempted at least 12 credits over an academic year – this includes the Summer, Fall, and Winter terms– your last annual GPA is calculated based on the number of courses you took and the grades achieved. If fewer than 12 credits were attempted in an academic year, no assessment will take place. In this case, credits will be forwarded to the next assessment when you accumulate the required number of credits.Academic standing is determined by your academic performance. It is measured by your grade point average (GPA).There are three academic standings:Students in either Conditional or Failed Standing will be notified, in writing, by the University of their academic standing. In this letter, students will be informed of all steps that the University has deemed necessary for them to follow. Students in failed standing must apply for readmission.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGPA assessment and academic standingFaculty of Arts and Science
