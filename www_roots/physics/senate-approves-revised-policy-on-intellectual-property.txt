http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2015/01/26/senate-approves-revised-policy-on-intellectual-property.htmlAt the January 16 Senate meeting, Concordia President Alan Shepard announced the launch of the strategic directions initiative — one that will involve idea groups exploring themes identified by Senate in December, small-group workshops and the speaker series, The Future of the University and the Future of Learning.The process, led by the Strategic Directions Advisory Committee, will engage students, faculty, staff, alumni and donors in converations to answer the question, “What’s next for Concordia”.  The speaker series will feature a cross-section of thought-leaders from across Canada and the U.S. Their insights and know-how will help the university to chart its strategic directions over the next decade.Benoit-Antoine Bacon, provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, provided an overview of Concordia’s strategic planning efforts over the past decade. Overall, he  emphasized, Concordia has successfully and consistently evolved in the direction set in its 2005-2010 academic plan Moving Ahead.Graham Carr, vice-president of Research and Graduate Studies, outlined proposed revisions to the Policy on Intellectual Property (VPRGS-9). In response to some concerns raised about the policy’s potential unintended impact on certain types of student coursework or new forms of extra-curricular initiatives, such as projects undertaken through District 3, a working group was established in early 2014.Mandated by the president and led by Associate Vice-President of Research Justin Powlowski, the working group’s membership included undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and intellectual property (IP) experts.The group reviewed the existing policy, specifically looking at student IP, and made several recommendations. These were endorsed by the Senate Research Committee after being circulated for comment and input from all Faculty Councils, the Council of the School of Graduate Studies and Academic Cabinet.Carr said the revisions will contribute to fostering and promoting a culture of open innovation and entrepreneurship at Concordia through activities such as District 3 and increased participation in student club activities.Senate approved the changes to the policy, which include excluding intellectual property created in the context of coursework and extra-curricular activities if it does not involve significant use of university resources, is not co-invented with a faculty member, and is not subject to agreements with funding agencies or companies.
Join us for an upcoming session of the speaker series, The Future of the University and the Future of Learning, which is part of Concordia’s strategic directions process.Randy Bass, vice-provost for Education at Georgetown University, takes the podium on February 5 to address the question of “What is next-generation learning?” On March 10, Elizabeth Cannon, president of the University of Calgary, will reflect on the question, “How can universities go from good to great?”To register for these presentations, please email directions@concordia.ca.
