http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/physics/programs/graduate/physics-phd.htmlThe PhD program in physics is a research-oriented, thesis-based degree program. It focuses on both fundamental and applied concepts of physics that reflect faculty research specializations. Program students receive an advanced training in up-to-date, general and field specific scientific literature and modern methodology together leading to novel research accomplishments that are publishable in peer reviewed scientific journals.The main research fields the students can choose from are: biophysics, computational physics and molecular modeling, condensed matter physics, laser optics and photonics, nano-scale and mesoscopic physics, particle physics, physics in education, and thin film physics. As indicated by the list above the department promotes research both in the traditional areas as well as in interdisciplinary fields. We take broad approach to the science of physics and explore also the interfaces between traditional and emerging fields.Department research activities are collaborative. Graduate students benefit from a robust cadre of faculty research expertise.
