http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/physics/programs/undergraduate/co-op-program.htmlIn North America, co-operative education is at the forefront of educational innovation, and Concordia University is proud to be a leader in the field. By alternating program-relevant work experience with academic study, co-op students graduate with the kind of practical experience that today's employers are seeking. Concordia was among the first universities in Canada to establish a co-operative education curriculum and leads the way in preparing students for real-world challenges. The Physics Co-operative program is offered to students who are enrolled in the BSc Specialization programs in Physics.The Physics Co-operative program is offered to students who are enrolled in all of the BSc Major, Specialization, and Honours programs in Physics. Students interested in applying for the Physics co-op should refer to section 24 of the Undergraduate Calendar where a full description of the admission requirements is provided. The Co-op director is Dr. Pablo Bianucci.Academic content is very similar to that of the regular programs, with some specific recommendations for courses to improve the students' job skills. While it is hoped that most of the positions will be in the Montreal area, students must be prepared to work in other parts of Canada.Students are supervised personally and must meet the requirements specified by the Faculty of Arts and Science and the Institute for Co-operative Education in order to continue their studies in the co-op format.Liaison between the student, the employers, and the Institute for Co-operative Education is provided by the Physics co-op committee, which includes the student's advisors.Please refer to the co-op section of the Concordia web site for the schedule of Study and Work terms and the full description of admission requirements.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityCo-op programDepartment of Physics
