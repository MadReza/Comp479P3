http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/cissc/working-groups/revisiting-montreals-diversities.htmlBringing an array of disciplinary perspectives (sociology, history, literature)  to bear on Montreal neighbourhoods, this group will focus on five case studies:  Parc Extension; Saint-Henri; Montréal-Nord; Côte-des-Neiges and Longueuil. Interested faculty members from Concordia as well as students will be invited to join in neighbourhood visits and meetings. The project aims to connect academics, community organizers, and citizens to start a three-way conversation that can lead to greater knowledge, insights, data, and richer narratives. The second objective is to constitute a bank of iconographic, oral, and written documents that different communities can tap into and continue to enrich. Finally, the group will contribute to events during the 375th anniversary of Montreal—including contributing to a monthly feature on neighbourhoods in the Journal de Montréal. Sherry Simon, Dép. d’études françaises, sherry.simon@concordia.caJean-Philippe Warren, Sociology and Anthropology, jean-philippe.warren@concordia.caSteven High, History and Oral History Centre, steven.high@concordia.caHow are Montreal’s neighbourhoods changing and how are these changes understood by Montrealers? Who speaks and who’s heard when talking about ethnic and cultural diversity in the city? Are some diversities less threatening than others?Coming soon. © Concordia UniversityAbout the Centre
