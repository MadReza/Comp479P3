Department of Physics, Faculty of Arts & ScienceThe basic laws of physics are applied in advancements in many areas including modern medical and space-related technologies, climate research as well as energy generation and storage. As the study of physics continues to evolve through new discoveries, we need inquisitive minds to explore the connections between traditional and emerging research areas, including medical and nano-scale physics, and biophysics.The MSc in Physics provides you with broad degree training for you to investigate fundamental and applied concepts that reflect faculty research specializations. Our cross-listed faculty members are experts in fields as varied as bioengineering and chemistry, and contribute to an environment that stresses strong student-supervisor relationships. For example, in collaboration with the PERFORM Centre, biomedical physics-related projects include using different imaging technologies to improve medical diagnostics and to investigate the effects of exercise on aging.Benefit from cutting-edge research centres that promote interdisciplinary collaborations in nanoscience, and the molecular and life sciences. For example, projects currently underway at the Centre for NanoScience Research examine the optical properties of nanomaterials, the link between light-induced electron transfer and accompanying protonational reactions, and the structure-function relationships in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes.Our MA students are looking at topics such as: Requirements for the DegreeAdmission Requirements. Applicants must have an honours degree, or its equivalent in Physics.

Residence. The minimum residence requirement is one year (3 terms) of full-time study, or the equivalent in part-time study.

Courses. The candidate is required to take the following:


9 credits chosen from PHYS 601, 602, 603, 609, 636, 637, 639, 642, 644, 646, 648, 649, 660 and 679.
Students may, with permission of their supervisor, substitute up to two courses from the following list:
CHEM 620 Selected Topics in Organic Chemistry
CHEM 630 Selected Topics in Physical Chemistry
CHEM 677 Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanism
CHEM 678 Protein Engineering and Design
CHEM 690 Selected Topics in Instrumentation
CHEM 692 Experimental Protein Chemistry
MAST 689 Variational Methods
MAST 694 Group Theory


PHYS 760: MSc Seminar on Selected Topics (3 credits). Students must give one seminar in the field of their research.




PHYS 790: Master’s Research and Thesis (33 credits): The thesis must represent the results of the student’s original research work undertaken after admission to this program. Work previously published by the student may be used only as introductory or background subject matter. The thesis is examined by a departmental committee. An oral examination is conducted to test the candidate’s ability to defend the thesis.

The thesis may be based on a study of a significant problem in physics or a research project conducted as part of the student’s employment. Permission to submit a thesis in the latter category is granted in the event that:
the student’s employer furnishes written approval for the pursuit and reporting of the project;
the student has research facilities which, in the opinion of the physics graduate studies committee, are adequate;
arrangements can be made for supervision of the project by a faculty member of the Department of Physics;
in all but exceptional cases, the student has direct supervision by a qualified supervisor at the site of the student’s employment. The supervisor must be approved by the physics graduate studies committee. A written working agreement between the supervisor and the university are required;
the proposed topic for the thesis, together with a brief statement outlining the proposed method of treatment, is approved by the physics graduate studies committee.
