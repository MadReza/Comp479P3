Does God exist? Do we live in a truly just society? Is love simply biological, or something more?These are some of the questions that have consumed civilization’s greatest thinkers — Voltaire, Galileo and Curie, to name a few — and continue to shape modern society.Such cornerstones of analytical thought and discussion have been praised, dissected and criticized in academia for centuries. Starting in September 2016, the Faculty of Arts and Science is offering all Concordia students the opportunity to take part in this tradition through an innovative new course.“Great thinkers, Great ideas, Great debates: Big ideas that shape and have shaped modern civilization,” will challenge undergraduates to explore fundamental questions posed in literature and the humanities, as well as in the natural and social sciences and the fine arts.The class was conceived by Eric Buzzetti and Jarrett Carty, principal and vice-principal of the Liberal Arts College respectively, and Calvin Kalman, principal of the Science College.“A university is meant to teach people to become decision makers and influencers,” Kalman says. The only way our students will be able fulfill these roles is if they have a broad understanding of civilization.”Each class will be led by two different guest lecturers. Over the term, a total of 23 different professors from 12 departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science will bring their unique perspectives to class. Students will drive the dialogue and reflection through what is known as a “flipped classroom model.” This means that students will reflect on material provided before class and will come to lectures knowing what they should discuss and dissect.After a presentation by the guest lecturer, an in-depth discussion will follow. Students will then be asked to write a one-page essay based on the class conversations and reading assignment.There will be no exam and the focus is on learning to enjoy the process of engaging intellectually with complex questions.“Critical thinking and the pursuit of knowledge should not be thought of as a chore, rather as something essential and fun,” explains Buzzetti. “It is central to who we are as human beings.”
André Roy, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science says the course’s innovative teaching model and interdisciplinary structure exemplifies a new direction for the faculty.“It brings together two colleges known for their academic excellence and engages students in novel ways of exploring rich and diverse subject matter. This is the next generation of learning at Concordia and hopefully is just the beginning of these types of initiatives.”The course is suitable for all students in any faculty. Please note that students can register under either of the following course codes: LBCL 298 or SCOL 398.
