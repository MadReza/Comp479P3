This international curatorial internship will bridge two cultural regions through the development of an exhibition program that will introduce artists from Mexico City to the Montreal cultural community. As curatorial ambassador, Belshaw will begin the internship at SOMA, a non-profit organization conceived to nurture discussion and exchange in the field of contemporary art and education in Mexico City. She will conclude the internship at the FOFA Gallery, working with the research produced during her time in Mexico.Two choirs in one evening! Jean-Sébastien Allaire leads the largest performing ensemble in the university in this popular concert of choral music. The university choir, made up of students, staff and the community, give their all to celebrate the end of the semester.  Kathy Kennedy directs the chamber choir in a program for a smaller, more intimate choir, singing repertoire from the Renaissance to the present day. The act of singing is one of the most unifying human abilities – both for the singers and the audience. Listen, breathe, and enjoy. The Eclectik Ensemble is a different kind of Concordia Big Band, always drawing from the Jazz repertoire but orchestrating their sound with a varied and fearless mix of instruments. This semester’s version will be five winds, four electric guitars, electric and acoustic pianos, vibraphone, bass and drums. We will be playing works from Mingus, Monk and Swallow arranged and orchestrated by some of Montreal’s most talented writers.
Step back into the jazz age with Dave Turner and the Concordia Big Band. The closing concert of the semester will send you out with that great brass and reed sound in your ears, some fabulous singers in your mind's eye, and wishing you had brought your dancing shoes. Swing into the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall for an unforgettable evening.  Directed by Dave Turner. Geordie production's holiday gala fundraiser production.Annual children's Christmas concert by the Suzuki institute of music.The killing of Freddy Villanueva on August 9, 2008 by police officer Jean-Loup Lapointe at the Henri-Bourassa Arena in the Montreal Nord area brought visibility to issues of police surveillance, institutional power asymmetries and racial profiling. For his exhibition 'MTL Nord', Victor Arroyo used counter-surveillance video to reflect on relationships between identity, site, history, and memory. Arroyo’s work seeks to challenge institutional power asymmetries in documentary practices at the intersection of everyday life, site-specific issues of social justice, and political oppression.Natalie Nadeau's exhibition 'Chip Production' deconstructs manufacturing processes, emulating that of tool die or auto part production, and gives significance to the waste that is created during these processes. It aims to illustrate the kind of elegance and seduction that material refuse can take on as it reveals the finished product. A romanticized observation of the factory worker is portrayed through the bronze casted work gloves. The work is an homage to the materiality of mass production while recognizing the importance of the hand of a worker within these ultra-mechanical environments. © Concordia UniversityMel Hoppenheim School of CinemaConcordia UniversityMel Hoppenheim School of Cinema

A talk in the Philosophy Department's Speaker SeriesPhilosophy MA defencePhilosophy MA defenceThe Department of Philosophy presents a lecture by Anne O'Byrne of Stony Brook University.2016 annual conference organized by the Graduate Philosophy Students' Association (GPSA). What is the potential of the new biotechnology? What are the pitfalls?This is part of the Department of Philosophy's Speaker Series 2014-15Recent empirical studies suggest that implicit bias is widespread in many communities. Others suggest that these kinds of biases are likely to spoil the reliability of racial descriptors, and in an especially problematic way – causing already stigmatized communities to be unduly subjected to suspicion and scrutiny. I argue this gives these law enforcement agencies strong reasons to suspend this use of racial descriptors until they present further research that shows these worries are ultimately unfounded.It is a commonly held view that Kant's system of metaphysics, as expounded in his Critique of Pure Reason and subsequent work, was definitively refuted by the late 19th and early 20th century developments in mathematics and the natural sciences.Political concerns about who knows, and the ways in which values infuse authoritative and trustworthy knowledge, have been central to feminist epistemology but continue to be neglected within traditional analytic epistemology, despite a recent contextual turn within the field.This paper explores aspects of the transcendence/immanence distinction that maybe useful in analyzing female embodiment. Particularly, I will concentrate on showing that the distinction could be productively used in the context of Iris Marion Young’s essay “Throwing Like a Girl.”Lecture by Dan Zahavi, Department of Media, Cognition and Communication, University of Copenhagen.Affiliated Lecture SeriesMontreal Inter-University Workshop in the History of Philosophy  Interuniversity Research Group in Political Philosophy (GRIPP) (Profs.

This international curatorial internship will bridge two cultural regions through the development of an exhibition program that will introduce artists from Mexico City to the Montreal cultural community. As curatorial ambassador, Belshaw will begin the internship at SOMA, a non-profit organization conceived to nurture discussion and exchange in the field of contemporary art and education in Mexico City. She will conclude the internship at the FOFA Gallery, working with the research produced during her time in Mexico.Two choirs in one evening! Jean-Sébastien Allaire leads the largest performing ensemble in the university in this popular concert of choral music. The university choir, made up of students, staff and the community, give their all to celebrate the end of the semester.  Kathy Kennedy directs the chamber choir in a program for a smaller, more intimate choir, singing repertoire from the Renaissance to the present day. The act of singing is one of the most unifying human abilities – both for the singers and the audience. Listen, breathe, and enjoy. The Eclectik Ensemble is a different kind of Concordia Big Band, always drawing from the Jazz repertoire but orchestrating their sound with a varied and fearless mix of instruments. This semester’s version will be five winds, four electric guitars, electric and acoustic pianos, vibraphone, bass and drums. We will be playing works from Mingus, Monk and Swallow arranged and orchestrated by some of Montreal’s most talented writers.
Step back into the jazz age with Dave Turner and the Concordia Big Band. The closing concert of the semester will send you out with that great brass and reed sound in your ears, some fabulous singers in your mind's eye, and wishing you had brought your dancing shoes. Swing into the Oscar Peterson Concert Hall for an unforgettable evening.  Directed by Dave Turner. Geordie production's holiday gala fundraiser production.Annual children's Christmas concert by the Suzuki institute of music.The killing of Freddy Villanueva on August 9, 2008 by police officer Jean-Loup Lapointe at the Henri-Bourassa Arena in the Montreal Nord area brought visibility to issues of police surveillance, institutional power asymmetries and racial profiling. For his exhibition 'MTL Nord', Victor Arroyo used counter-surveillance video to reflect on relationships between identity, site, history, and memory. Arroyo’s work seeks to challenge institutional power asymmetries in documentary practices at the intersection of everyday life, site-specific issues of social justice, and political oppression.Natalie Nadeau's exhibition 'Chip Production' deconstructs manufacturing processes, emulating that of tool die or auto part production, and gives significance to the waste that is created during these processes. It aims to illustrate the kind of elegance and seduction that material refuse can take on as it reveals the finished product. A romanticized observation of the factory worker is portrayed through the bronze casted work gloves. The work is an homage to the materiality of mass production while recognizing the importance of the hand of a worker within these ultra-mechanical environments. © Concordia UniversityAbout
