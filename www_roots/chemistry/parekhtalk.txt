http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/polisci/wssr/2017/03/30/parekhtalk.html On Canada's 150th birthday, it is important not only to reflect on the past, but also to look forward to the next 150 years.As a liberal democracy, Canada is well recognized as one that values diversity, seeks to protect rights and freedoms for all its citizens, and endeavours to ensure the welfare of all members of its community. This said, the principles of liberalism and democracy can be complementary but may often be conflictual as well.
On March 30th at 5:30pm, Lord Bhikhu Parekh, Professor of Political Theory and Labour Member of the UK House of Lords, will join the WSSR for an evening talk and reception. He will discuss the ways in which liberal democracy may be reconstituted to alleviate some of the many pressures facing it in the 21st century. The registration fee for this talk and reception is $15.
