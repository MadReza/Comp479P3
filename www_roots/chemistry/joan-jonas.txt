Joan Jonas is a world-renowned artist whose work encompasses a wide range of media including video, performance, installation, sound, text and sculpture. Trained in art history and sculpture, Jonas was a central figure in the performance art movement of the late 1960s, and her experiments and productions in the late 1960s and early 1970s continue to be crucial to the development of many contemporary art genres, from performance and video to conceptual art and theatre. Since 1968, her practice has explored ways of seeing, the rhythms of rituals, and the authority of objects and gestures. Jonas has exhibited, screened and performed her work at museums, galleries and large scale group exhibitions throughout the world.Joan Jonas with Jason Moran is a lecture performance with live piano and video projections, as well as improvisational actions. Throughout the evening, Jonas and Moran will interact with each other as they demonstrate examples from their ten years of collaboration, starting with the performance The Shape, The Scent, the Feel of Things from 2005 up to the most recent performance They Come to Us without a Word, commissioned for the U.S. pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2015 and currently on view at DHC/ART.Jonas comes to Montreal in conjunction with Joan Jonas: From Away, curated by Barbara Clausen and on view at the DHC/ART Foundation for Contemporary Art until September 18, 2016.Admission to this event is free of charge.
