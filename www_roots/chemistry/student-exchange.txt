http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/philosophy/student-life/student-exchange.htmlOur department has organized a student exchange with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Münster, Germany. Each year a small number of independent Philosophy majors and Master's students have the chance to study abroad for a maximum of two terms. Credits that are acquired during the stay are transfered to students' programs of study.To receive additional information on the exchange, send a brief email to our Student Exchange Coordinator.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityStudent exchangeDepartment of Philosophy
