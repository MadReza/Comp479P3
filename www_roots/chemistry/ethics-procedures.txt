http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/applied-human-sciences/student-life/ethics-procedures.htmlAll research in the Department of Applied Human Sciences follows these guiding ethical principles:The Department Human Research Ethics Committee (DHREC) for Applied Human Sciences reviews all undergraduate and graduate student research with human subjects conducted as part of course requirements to ensure that all projects involving human subjects conducted by students are following the ethical protocol approved by the University. For more information on the DHREC, including its current membership, please download the AHSC Ethics Committee Mandate and Membership.The following ethics resources are available for undergraduate course instructors.Instructors supervising MA or PhD projects (excluding AHSC 698) should refer to and follow the procedures associated with the Disciplinary College.The following ethics resources are available for student researchers:Evaluation forms and needs assessments do not fall under the category of data collection; rather they are considered instances of performance review or quality assurance, and are not subject to consent forms. However, if the site insists on certain requirements, such as a consent form from parents, then you must comply with this requirement.The ethics committee strongly suggests an institutional consent form, or at least a contract between the student and the organization, in order to have clarity regarding mutual expectations and to protect the student. Students are expected to behave ethically at all times. The following ethics resources are available for fieldwork and internship students: The Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS) describes the ethics policies of three Canadian research agencies: CIHR, NSERC, and SSHRC. These agencies only fund individuals and institutions that comply with this policy on research involving humans.A tutorial on the TCPS is available:TCPS Tutorial in English
