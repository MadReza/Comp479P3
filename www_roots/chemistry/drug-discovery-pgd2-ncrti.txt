http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/chemistry/2014/11/07/drug-discovery-pgd2-ncrti.htmlThis presentation will review two drug discovery projects; prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) receptor antagonist project for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and hyperlipidemia, and nucleotide competing reverse transcriptase (NcRTI) for the treatment of HIV infection. In particular, this seminar will focus on approaches employed during the optimization of several chemical series to identify clinical candidates. In the PGD2 antagonist project, strategies to reduce biliary excretion and mitigate the formation of reactive intermediates will be presented. This research led to discovery of the clinical candidate Laropiprant. As part of the NcRTI research program, approaches to improve the oral bioavailability of a novel tricyclic series of HIV inhibitors will be discussed. Taken together, these two case studies illustrate the challenges encountered in drug discovery and the power of chemistry to address important biological questions and human health issues.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
