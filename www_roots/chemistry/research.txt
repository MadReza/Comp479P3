Explore research at ConcordiaJournalsConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/chrcs/research.htmlThe  Centre strives to nurture research partnerships between Centre 
researchers and the community, and to support the dissemination of 
research outcomes to the community at large.  In order to further these 
objectives, research programs may be supported in a variety of ways, 
including putting on collaborative forums; administration; publications;
 workshops; research seminars; and follow up initiatives to further the 
outcomes of research programs.The Centre's focus is on improving the quality of community 
and/or organizational life. New knowledge generated will improve current
 practice in the local context. That is, rather than focusing on the 
development of generalized abstract theory, the Centre is involved in 
programs that express a pragmatic research-practice mix. New knowledge 
generated should be useable immediately by the community. As well, the 
Centre values the dissemination of locally produced knowledge to a 
larger and broader audience in order to promote the transfer of 
effective community practices.Both qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods data 
collection and analyses within practice-oriented collaborative and joint
 action research, participatory action research, or participatory 
research methodologies are appropriate research endeavours. Simple 
survey research is also considered appropriate within the context of a 
larger research program. The Centre researcher and the community 
organization share joint management and use of  data coming out of 
research partnerships. Knowledge deliverables and project outcomes may 
be published by CHRCS as part of its purpose to disseminate practice 
knowledge to a larger and broader audience.Concordia University and the Centre are involved in a consulting project to help CHSSN develop a framework for future leaders within their community network. (2015)Young people who are placed in group care or foster care because of neglect or abuse often have no alternative but to move out on their own when services end at age 18. AHSC professor Varda Mann-Feder has pulled together a collaborative ad hoc committee of Concordia University students and young adults formerly in care. The committee aims to create the “Youth in Care Network” in Quebec, a first in the province. (2014, ongoing)This initiative aims to support and strengthen inter-organizational collaboration amongst 25 community organizations in order to meet community needs. A SOAR process was used to develop strategic plans for the various organizations, followed by a summit to present findings and improve cooperation in future service provision. (2013-2015)ACDPN works with the English-speaking Black community in Montreal to ensure access to services and prevention resources. The Centre and members of the Applied Human Sciences Department are helping ACDPN to build organizational infrastructure, and to identify needs through community consultation. This project is being conducted in collaboration with multiple Black community associations. (2013, ongoing)© Concordia UniversityCentre for Human Relations and Community Studies (CHRCS)
