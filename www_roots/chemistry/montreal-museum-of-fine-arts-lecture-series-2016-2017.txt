Prior to the establishment of these galleries, the annual “Do you own a Canadian Picture?” sales organized by the volunteer women’s committees of Canadian art museums supplied the market for contemporary Canadian art. Initiated by the Women’s Committee of the Art Gallery of Toronto in 1947, the one-day sale was replicated by the committees of the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1948, the Winnipeg Art Gallery in 1949, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1958. Taking place in a period when most museums had little interest in contemporary art and there were few commercial galleries, these annual sales provided an important vehicle for living Canadian artists to sell their work. This talk will examine the history of these art sales, and explore the role of volunteer women in establishing a market for contemporary Canadian art.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University

Hundreds of men and horses, adorned with ribbons and beadwork, formed a single line before charging into a buffalo herd. Finely dressed men on horseback patrolled and negotiated boundaries. Dances, or lii bals, welcomed visitors, bade them farewell, and celebrated weddings and safe returns. Women wrapped themselves in brilliant prints and lifted their skirts to reveal richly embroidered moccasins and leggings. These were social, economic and political spaces, turned into dazzling visual displays as women combined silk, wool, buckskin, fur, beads and porcupine quills to assert presence and claim territory.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
