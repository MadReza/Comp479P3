http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/chemistry/programs/undergraduate.htmlThe department's aim is to offer the best undergraduate education in chemistry or biochemistry whether it is for a student who is intending to be a specialist, or one who is taking courses in chemistry as a requirement of some other career or for general interest.The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry offers BSc Honours, BSc Specialization, BSc Major, and Minor programs in Chemistry.The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry offers BSc Honours, BSc Specialization, and BSc Major programs in Biochemistry.The Co-op programs have the same academic course requirements as the honours or specialization programs (in chemistry or biochemistry). However, Coop students alternate their academic semesters with off-campus paid work terms in government or industrial laboratories.The different levels are the Honours, Specialization, Major and Minor programmes. Traditionally Canadian universities required an Honours degree to qualify for admission to a graduate program. In Quebec both the Specialization and the Honours program are accepted as entrance requirements.The difference between the Honours program and the Specialization program is the higher performance level demanded in the Honours program (See Undergraduate Calendar Section 31.003) and the inclusion of the Research Project and Thesis (CHEM 450), which requires independent research work of the student and an oral defence of the thesis before the Department. The Specialization in the chemistry program has the Independent Study and Practicum (CHEM 419), where the student carries out independent study and practical work under the direction of a faculty member. The work is presented to the Department in the form of a scientific poster.Many professors recommend, and some require that students in these courses attend or have attended a seminar on plagiarism and the ethical use of information sources. For more information, see the beginning of the section on individual course descriptions.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityUndergraduate programsDepartment of Chemistry & Biochemistry
