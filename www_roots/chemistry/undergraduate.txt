A major in women's studies appeals to students who are passionate about feminism and who would like to devote themselves to studying its history, theory, and political action.42 credits
A BA Specialization is the best option if you are interested in going on to graduate studies. A BA Specialization requires students to research and write a thesis. This project helps prepare students for advanced academic study. Previous Institute graduates have pursued advanced studies in Women's Studies, Communications, and Law.60 credits
Combined with a major in another field, a Minor in Women's Studies offers students new and critical ways to think about knowledge. In the past, students majoring in History, English, Communications, or Studio Arts have pursued a Minor in Women's Studies.
The Certificate in Women's Studies is intended for individuals who would like to pursue Women's Studies in greater depth. Certificate students are individuals who meet the undergraduate admission requirements and who would like to pursue Women's Studies in greater depth.

Our students can choose from a variety of undergraduate programs.
Many students have chosen to combine their studies in political science with the experience of studying in one of Concordia's specialized colleges, such as the School of Community and Public Affairs, the Simone de Beauvoir Institute, the Liberal Arts College, and the Loyola College for Diversity and Sustainability.Our graduates have proceeded to work in such areas as public administration, law, human rights, journalism, and political campaigning. Some have entered competitive politics, and others have found satisfying work with non-governmental organizations or with corporations. The possibilities are wide open, and it is our job to give you the intellectual background to take advantage of them.Our Co-op program is an option for undergraduates in the Political Science program. Graduate with the equivalent of one year of full-time compensated employment related to their field of study and career objectives.The Minor in Political Science is a 24 credit program from other disciplines designed to be combined with another Major, Specialization or Honours. Human rights studies encompasses the eternal drive to improve the human condition, and attendant debates over the primacy of the individual within society and the universal versus relativist approach to rights, positive and negative freedoms. © Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityUndergraduate programsDepartment of Political Science

The emphasis in the digital production workshops (radio, TV, print and on-line) is on practical skills, with newsroom standards applied to all assignments and activities. Students work in "live" news situations, covering news events just like working professional journalists. These workshops are complemented by seminars and lecture courses that focus on why journalism has meaning and value in a democratic society. This blend of theory and practice gives students the foundation they need for a journalism career. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the internship and coop opportunities that the department provides.

            Degree optionsConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/coms/programs/undergraduate.htmlThe undergraduate program in Communication Studies at Concordia is internationally renowned, and deservedly so. Indeed, students come from all over the world to be a part of it. Many of them are intrigued by our combined approach to theory and production – think media, practice media. In addition to offering three production streams (intermedia, sound, video) we offer courses that provide a strong theoretical and critical understanding of the communicative processes that constitute the complex world we live in. Our students have access to excellent facilities – classrooms, labs/studios, production equipment – all of which are continually serviced, and updated annually.Some students choose our popular Cultural Studies option, involving in-depth study of the social, cultural, political and aesthetic aspects of media and communication. NB This option specifically precludes production classes.Our program is unique because of the outstanding, award-winning teaching, research, and research-creation activities of our distinguished faculty, and because of the range of classes we offer that deal with historical and contemporary issues such as: media and religion; food, film and politics; sound walks; non-linear storytelling; crime genres; even vampires. I encourage you to check out the course offerings and our faculty and staff pages to get a better sense of our program and the accomplishments of our entire team.Our alumnae, faculty, staff, and students are committed to making a difference. Students make a point of getting out of the classroom and into the community through applied internships or by submitting their work to competitive events like the Montreal World Film Festival. We are proud to be considered the best communications program in Canada. Students not only choose our program but they excel here.If you are interested in visiting us, I recommend two opportunities. The first is a university wide open house and our department offers tours of our facilities and an information table. This is usually held annually in late October. We also offer an information session for admission directors and students in early December.Still have questions? Please contact Program Director:Matt Soar
