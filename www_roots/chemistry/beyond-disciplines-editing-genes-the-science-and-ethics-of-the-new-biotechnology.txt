CRISPR technology (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) now allows virtually anyone to re-write genetic code. While this technology has enormous scientific potential, ethical questions persist. How far are we prepared to go when it comes to editing genes?Join host Professor David Secko (Department of Journalism) as he examines these questions with a panel of Concordia experts.Professor Alisa Piekny (Department of Biology)
