http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/student-life/student-relations.htmlThe Office of Student Relations is a resource for all Fine Arts students, faculty and staff interested in accessing or knowing more about Fine Arts student life activities, including arts related governance, gallery direction, festival production, resource centre management and non-profit arts related businesses.In addition to cultivating links between the wider student population and extra-curricular student-run projects such as Art Matters, Café X, Fine Arts Reading Room and the VAV Gallery, the Office of Student Relations liaises with student-run organizations to help ensure the success of these projects in an arm’s length capacity and can be called upon by the Fine Arts Students Alliance as an impartial arm’s length resource at the request of FASA or those participating in its programs.

The Office of Student Relations is the link between all student-run projects and the Office of the Dean, Faculty of Fine Arts and wider University community. The Student Relations coordinator also oversees Travel Grants to Undergraduate Students, a fund for department-organized exhibitions of student work, and the Graduating Students Exhibition.Student Relations Coordinator
