http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/finearts/art-history/2015/11/relations--journal-call-for-writing---art.htmlRelations, a branch project of the Indigenous Art Research Group (IARG), is a Concordia-based journal addressing Indigenous art and art history. For the inaugural issue of Relations, we invite academic writing, experimental writing, and artwork that address art, art institutions, spatial theory, architecture, critiques of art historical discourse, material culture, inter-media works as it relates to Indigenous/settler relations, and reconciliation. All historical periods and geographic areas pertaining to Canada’s legacy of Indian Residential Schools and/or the theme of Truth and Reconciliation, as it pertains to settler colonial policy are welcome. Recognizing that Canada provided a model for other settler colonial nations, comparative essays incorporating other geographical locals are also welcome if they are relevant to the topic.
