http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/main/2016/11/18/god-save-justin-trudeau-concordia.htmlThe Department of Communication Studies of Concordia University, in collaboration with Productions de la ruelle, will host a screening and conversation with the director of the documentary film God Save Justin Trudeau.

The showing of the documentary will be followed by a public discussion with the award-winning filmmaker Guylaine Maroist, Concordia faculty and students.

The event will take place in the CJ Building room 1.114 on Nov. 18, at 2 p.m.

The film offers a close look at the personality of the Liberal leader and at the contemporary style of Canadian politics in relation to the media.

In the film, original cinematography and rare archival footage provide a candid and unscripted portrayal of Trudeau like we’ve never seen him before, and possibly never will again. More importantly, the film raises troubling questions about the practice of showmanship which has become a prominent reality in Canadian politics.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
