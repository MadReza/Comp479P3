Their activity is increased in times of metabolic demand (i.e. exercise, fasting, exposure to cold temperatures) to enhance cellular energy production and adapt to the changing nutrient environments. Altered expression and activity of these metabolic regulators is shown in many pathophysiological conditions, suggesting that these proteins may play a significant role in the progression of diseases including hepatosteatosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We aim to understand the molecular and physiological consequences of altering PGC-1 expression in different tissues and determine whether targeting this protein family could be beneficial to prevent or treat metabolic disease.Dr. Nguyen is the guest of Prof. Ann English© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
