Even ten years ago this footage was not available. It was brought over from the UK. Their archive is completely new and I am definitely on the early wave of scholars writing on this,” says Webb Jekanowski.  “This is a fascinating period of Canadian film history," adds Webb Jekanowski. "Usually scholars have focused on NFB productions or Nanook of the North, but there are lots of promotional and industrial films that were made then that will widen the conversation about Canadian film at this time. There’s just so much more to discover.”Kester Dyer won the Pratley award in 2014 for his research on the Wapikoni mobile cinema initiative. This year, Dyer won the FSAC Student Writing Award for his essay "‘Against National Orthodoxy’: 24 heures ou plus and Fourth Cinema."Kester's essay took up questions of national and transnational cinema and politics from the 1970s to the present. The jury felt the essay provided a provocative reading of the work and career of Gilles Groulx and teased out complex interrelationships between a Third Cinema and a Fourth.“Kester Dyer’s research on the Quebecois filmmaker Gilles Groulx challenges conventional nationalist assumptions by positioning him within an international critical context,” says Russell.Read more about the awards given by the FSAC.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFSAC award winners: Third year in a row for Film Studies PhDsMel Hoppenheim School of Cinema
