http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/finearts/2016/02/13/intergenerational-video-game-design-workshop.htmlAre you interested in game design that focuses on making games for people of all ages? If so, you are invited to attend a two-day workshop with video game designer and gerontoludics researcher Dr. Bob De Schutter.

Using collaborative design strategies, participants will have the chance to conceptualize and create prototypes for video games that hold appeal for all ages. These design strategies will be informed by Dr. De Schutter's research and design practice, which challenge the notion that younger generations are the only people interested in video game play.

The two-day workshop will begin with a discussion of Dr. De Schutter’s empirical and theoretical work on games and ageing. Dr. De Schutter will also highlight some of the challenges of gerontoludic game design and make design recommendations. Attendees will spend the remainder of the workshop conceptualizing and applying the creative techniques of game design. The workshops are scheduled from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, and from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sunday. No prior game design or academic knowledge required. This workshop is open to people of all ages and will be held in an accessible venue.
