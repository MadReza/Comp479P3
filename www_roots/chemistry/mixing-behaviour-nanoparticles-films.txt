Our recent studies into the formation and properties of alkylthiol-capped gold nanoparticle films at planar interfaces will be presented. We have been exploring the properties of these films when in the presence of surfactants, hydrocarbons, as well as liquid crystalline oils. I will present the unusual mixing behaviour for gold nanoparticle Langmuir films that our studies have revealed, and discuss the significance and implications of the rules of thumb for achieving good mixing determined to date.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
