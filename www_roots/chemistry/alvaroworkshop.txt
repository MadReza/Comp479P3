For several years, Amanda Alvaro, political commentator and co-founder at Pomp & Circumstance, has done just this.Former advisor to several Ministers, Premiers and Prime Minister, Alvaro has worked as a political strategist, analyst, marketer and communications expert for nearly 15 years – most recently on the Trudeau campaign in 2015. In her one-day workshop on March 10th, you will get the chance to find out what politicking and campaigning is like from the inside. Alvaro will also explore the challenges faced by the Liberal party in Canadian democracy today and the stresses it may face moving forward under and ever-image-conscious, young, and highly popular Justin Trudeau.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
