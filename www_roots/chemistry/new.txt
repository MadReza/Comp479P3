Whether you are an undergrad or graduate student, you can make a smooth transition by attending an orientation, connecting with your fellow students and more! Are you a new grad student? Check out our services just for you.  

  Orientations give you the chance to learn about your new campus, meet new people, make new friends and find out what it takes to be a successful student.Each year, we facilitate over 200 free workshops, fairs and events around campus.  Take note of these essential resources. You'll need these on speed dial for first year, just in case.  Check in with us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, we want to know how you're doing. Ask us for help, directions or have a chat with a mentor.   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;SGW: (514) 848-2424, ext. 7369
