Watch the President's video messageOver the past few months, we’ve had a number of conversations across campus to talk about Concordia’s future.We’ve had lively and thoughtful discussions, influenced by our speaker series, idea cafés and our seven working groups that examined the following topics: the future of learning and experiential learning, innovation and entrepreneurship, international strategy, next-generation academic structures, next-generation student skills and expectations, public/community engagement and research. I want to thank everyone for participating in this important initiative.As part of our first phase, we are releasing a preliminary draft document that outlines our high-level strategic directions, and we invite your input. This document distills the feedback we’ve received about what Concordia wants and needs to do in order to thrive in the decade ahead.In contrast to conventional strategic planning documents, you won’t find any long discourses, action items, or budget lines. Instead, we’ve come up with a short list of areas where Concordia should focus its efforts as we define what it means to be a next-generation university. We’ve also used language that will make our directions feel fresh, accessible and direct.I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to the members of the Strategic Directions Advisory Committee – 40 faculty, staff, researchers and students – for their hard work and many contributions.I invite you to watch my video message, which provides more information. Plus, you can access the document here.On May 1 and 4, we are holding two Idea Cafés for students, faculty and staff to give their feedback. If you plan to participate, please pre-register and come prepared with some ideas after reading the document.  We hope to see you there!I encourage you to give us your feedback by May 6 to directions@concordia.ca. We plan to present a revised version to Senate on May 17.Once we’ve confirmed our broad strategic directions later this spring, we will launch the second phase of our process this fall. This will involve more detailed action planning work at the Faculty and unit levels.As I've said many times before, this is an era in which urban universities are poised to succeed – and dynamic places like Concordia in a great city like Montreal are especially well positioned to thrive.I look forward to hearing from you and to continuing our work together to make this a truly great university.
