http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/finearts/theatre/2014/01/02/60-x-60-performance.htmlSixty musical works, 60 seconds or less, played in succession for a total of 60 minutes, with a giant clock keeping count. That's 60x60, an event concept that's spread across the world in the decade since it was created to showcase a maximum amount of new music to the largest possible audience. Initially featuring music only, the format lends itself to collaborations with artists from other disciplines such as video and dance, each work of which also lasts 60 seconds. On January 15, the departments of Music, Theatre and Contemporary Dance will be joining forces at the D.B. Clarke Theatre to present a unique version of 60x60 that includes theatre and dance elements.It's a multi-sensory production/performance," says Eldad Tsabary, an assistant professor in the music department and former Canadian director of 60x60 who brought the event to Concordia. "The opportunity to work with artists of other media is very inspiring," he says. "It's interesting to see dance, theatre and electroacoustic students discussing and using the same terms - such as 'texture' - but meaning different things. This process expands their concepts of creativity."Juried musical works will be arranged into a macro-composition exactly one hour long and then uploaded, in sequence, to a private webpage. The participating dance and theatre students will choose the pieces they want to interpret by visiting the page to listen to the music and reading the brief descriptions of the composers and the works.Several 60x60 events have been held at Concordia since 2008, including the Canadian debut in 2009 of 60x60 Dance, for which dance students choreographed works to accompany each composition, and the first 60x60 +Dance +Theatre event 2013.With files from Liz CromptonSearch for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia University60x60 Performance just around the cornerNews
