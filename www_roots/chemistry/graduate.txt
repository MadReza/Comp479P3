Work in our program brings the philosophy of values, philosophy of the sciences, and philosophy of human identity & difference into a dynamic intersection.This helps advance research and teaching both in and beyond philosophy, on topics ranging from climate change and biodiversity to global justice, gender, and embodiment. The expertise, scholarship and publications of our faculty extends across a spectrum of work in analytic philosophy, history of philosophy, and continental philosophy.An important objective of the MA in Philosophy is to equip students with a solid background for entering the best PhD programs in philosophy. Our placement record is a good indicator of the successes of our MA program graduates in this regard.While the Department of Philosophy offers an MA in Philosophy, Concordia University also offers a PhD in Humanities—an interdisciplinary program in which students may choose philosophy as their major discipline. Concordia also offers a specialized individualized program.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityGraduate programsDepartment of Philosophy
