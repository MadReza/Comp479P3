The most known example is acid base properties of amines and carboxylic acids. We are interested in hydrogen bond properties. The talk will give an overview of recent work how fluorination modifies the intermolecular hydrogen bond donating capacity of alcohols, and how it affects the lipophilicity of alkanols. The first examples of intramolecular OH•••F hydrogen bonding in acyclic, saturated fluorohydrins will be shown, and finally, we give the first example of a polyfluorinated sugar ligand having a higher affinity compared to the (hydroxylated) parent, with crystal structures even showing C-F mediated hydrogen bonding to bound water molecules. Some implications for drug design will be discussed.Dr Linclau graduated from Ghent University (Belgium) in 1992, and also did his Phd there (1996) on the total synthesis of vitamin D analogues. This was followed by a postdoc at the University of Pittsburgh (Prof Dennis Curran) working on fluorous separation chemistry. He was appointed in Southampton as a lecturer in 1999, and became full professor in Organic Chemistry this year. Current research is very much centered on organofluorine chemistry, from investigating how fluorination modifies molecular properties as well as properties of (adjacent) functional groups, to applying this knowledge in the synthesis of fluorinated analogues of bioactive compounds. A large programme involving heavily fluorinated carbohydrates as probes to investigate protein carbohydrate interactions is being pursued.He is the guest of Dr. Pat Forgione.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
