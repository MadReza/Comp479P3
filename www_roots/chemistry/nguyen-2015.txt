Under such conditions, bacterial stress responses induce protective mechanisms to ensure bacterial survival under stress. My group studies the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and how the stringent response, a conserved starvation and stress response, mediates multidrug tolerance. In particular, regulation of oxidative stress pathways by the stringent response modulates antibiotic lethality, and targeting such pathways may be a novel approach to sensitize tolerant bacteria to conventional antibiotic therapies.Dr. Nguyen is the guest of Prof. Dajana Vuckovic© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
