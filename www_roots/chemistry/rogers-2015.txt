http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/chemistry/2015/11/13/rogers-2015.htmlA resource supply that is both sustainable and adequate is one of the most significant barriers to increased infiltration of biomass conversion technologies and processes. Current biological and chemical approaches being taken to utilize biomass are limited by the difficulty in processing biomass and the energy needed for separation of the components. New and efficient solvents and process technologies are needed to help unlock the promise of biomass. These new technologies could provide new market opportunities for medical, forestry, agricultural, and fishing industries as we move toward a more sustainable biomass-based economy. With a plethora of abundant natural and renewable resources (in terms of both quantity and diversity), from water purification - to cosmetics - to medical applications, the quality of human life can greatly benefit (and improve at the same time) from new, innovative biomass-related technologies. With this mission in mind, we are exploring the entire range of the “biorefinery concept,” from dissolution, and conversion of biomass into value added chemicals and extraction of essential oils or vital chemicals from raw biomass sources,[1] to isolation of pure biopolymers and production of new biomaterials from them.[2] Because we can directly dissolve Nature’s biopolymers, we can shape them, functionalize them, blend them, and use other noncovalent means to produce advanced functional materials. These new, innovative materials represent new market opportunities which will develop and promote. Fig. 1. Left: Traditional biopolymer isolation-traditional pulping vs. IL process.
