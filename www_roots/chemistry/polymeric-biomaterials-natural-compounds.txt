We have used bile acids, natural amphiphilic compounds in our body, in the preparation of new polymers including hydrogels, dental resins, thermosensitive polymers and degradable elastomers with shape-memory properties. Oligomeric molecular pockets have also been made and are shown to be invertible depending on the polarity of the media.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
