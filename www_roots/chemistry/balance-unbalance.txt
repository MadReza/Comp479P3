This year's event takes place from May 9 to 13, 2016.
Designed to use art as a catalyst to explore intersections between nature, science, technology and society, BunB explores the intersection of ecological threats and transdisciplinary possibilities. The conference bring together artists, scientists, economists, philosophers, politicians, policy experts, sociologists and engineers from across the world with the intent of engendering a deeper awareness of and creating lasting intellectual working partnerships in solving the world's global environmental crisis.The 2016 conference participants will examine issues under the theme of "Data Science + Eco Action”.According to Dal Farra, we are living in a world here the equilibrium between a healthy environment and the interconnected economies is in peril, and that artists hold the key, in part, to finding a solution.
"Environmental problems, economic uncertainty and political complexity have been around for a long time. What was different before was the speed and depth of transformations compared with today’s sudden changes," he wrote on the BunB website."The arts could play a major part in helping the global society to understand the magnitude of the crisis we are facing, and in promoting the awareness around environmental matters. Artists could promote inter- and transdisciplinary actions focusing on our responsibility regarding the turning point we are living in defining the future of - human - life on Earth.”Other Concordia University faculty members involved in BunB include Carmela Cucuzzella (Department of Design and Computation Arts) and Peter Stoett (Department of Political Science).For more information, visit the Balance-Unbalance 2016 website.
