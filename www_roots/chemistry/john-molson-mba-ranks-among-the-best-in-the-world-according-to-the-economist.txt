It covers four categories: opening new career opportunities (35 per cent of the ranking); personal development/educational experience (35 per cent); increasing salary (20 per cent); and the potential to network (10 per cent). The figures that The Economist collates are a mixture of hard data and subjective marks given by students. The ranking is weighted by what respondents found to be most important.According to the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), there are over 13,000 business schools in the world. “To be ranked among the best by a publication such as The Economist is excellent news indeed,” says JMSB Dean Steve Harvey. “The business school environment is extremely competitive and there are many great schools. This acknowledgment helps strengthen our reputation as one of the pace-setters in business education.”The Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago retained the top spot in the rankings, while the highest ranked Canadian institution was York University’s Schulich School of Business (no. 41). HEC Montréal was the only other Canadian school to feature in the rankings (no. 79).Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityJohn Molson MBA ranks among the best in the world according to The EconomistNews
