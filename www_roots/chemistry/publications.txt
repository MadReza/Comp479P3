In 1971 the National Gallery of Canada celebrated Wieland with its first solo show dedicated to a living Canadian woman artist. Johanne Sloan is Professor of Art History at Concordia University.

This is the third online art book in the ACI/IAC series written by a member of the Gail and Stephen A. Jarislowsky Institute for Studies in Canadian Art. The other titles are Paul-Émile Borduas: Life & Work by François-Marc Gagnon and Michael Snow: Life & Work by Martha Langford.LINK TO PUBLISHER ACI/IACThe history of women and art in Canada has often been celebrated as a story of progress from amateur to professional practice. Rethinking Professionalism challenges this narrative by questioning the assumptions that underlie the category of artistic professionalism, a construct as influential for artistic practice as it has been for art historical understanding.Through a series of in-depth studies, contributors examine changes to the infrastructure of the art world that resulted from a powerful discourse of professionalization that emerged in the late- nineteenth century. While many women embraced this new model, others fell by the wayside, barred from professional status by virtue of their class, their ethnicity, or the very nature of the artworks they produced. The richly illustrated essays in this collection depict the changing nature of the professional paradigm as it was experienced by women painters, photographers, craftspeople, architects, curators, gallery directors, and art teachers. In so doing, they demonstrate the ongoing power of feminist art history to disrupt patterns of thought that have become naturalized and, accordingly, invisible.Going beyond the narratives of recovery or exclusion that the category of professionalism has traditionally encouraged,Rethinking Professionalism explores the very consequences of telling the history of women's art in Canada through that lens.Contributors include Annmarie Adams (McGill University), Alena Buis (Queen's University), Sherry Farrell Racette (University of Manitoba), Cynthia Hammond (Concordia University), Kristina Huneault (Concordia University), Loren Lerner (Concordia University), Lianne McTavish (University of Alberta), Kirk Niergarth (Mount Royal University), Mary O'Connor (McMaster University), Sandra Paikowsky (Concordia University), Ruth B. Phillips (Carleton University), Jennifer Salahub (Alberta College of Art & Design), and Anne Whitelaw (Concordia University).LINK TO PUBLISHER McGill-Queen's University PressMaking a connection between photography and memory is almost automatic. Should it be? In Scissors, Paper, Stone Martha Langford explores the nature of memory and art. She challenges the conventional emphasis on the camera as a tool of perception by arguing that photographic works are products of the mind - picturing memory is, first and foremost, the expression of a mental process. Langford organizes the book around the conceit of the child's game scissors, paper, stone, using it to ground her discussion of the tensions between remembering and forgetting, the intersection of memory and imagination, and the relationship between memory and history. Scissors, Paper, Stone explores the great variety of photographic art produced by Canadian artists as expressions of memory. Their work, including images by Carl Beam, Carole Condé and Karl Beveridge, Donigan Cumming, Stan Denniston, Robert Houle, Robert Minden, Michael Snow, Diana Thorneycroft, Jeff Wall, and Jin-me Yoon, is presented as part of a rich interdisciplinary study of contemporary photography and how it has shaped modern memory.LINK TO PUBLISHER McGill-Queen's University PressThis book offers an interdisciplinary, feminist contribution to the architectural and social history of Bath, England. Approaching the world-renowned heritage of Bath with the methods of the architectural historian and the site-specific interventions of the contemporary artist, Hammond looks beyond and behind Bath's strategic marshaling of its past.As Hammond demonstrates, wealthy patrons, sex workers, symbols of idealized femininity and Edwardian feminist activists all made powerful spatial interventions in Bath's built environment. Yet little of that impact is known, much less recognized in the city's public history. This book presents the ways in which women of all classes shaped the buildings and landscapes of one of England's most architecturally significant cities. But this book is also an intervention into Bath's public memory; in it, the author describes how her site-specific works of art were strategic means to bring her archival findings to a broader public. Through both art and research, an interdisciplinary approach to the city, Hammond aims to transform as well as critique the urban image of Bath. At once a performative literature, an extensively researched history, and a feminist guide to the city, Architects, Angels, Activists engages with current struggles over urban signification in Bath and beyond.LINK TO PUBLISHER Ashgate PublishingJean Berger is the most documented painter of New France and yet none of his works exist to-day.Jean Berger, peintre et complice? by Professor François-Marc Gagnon presents all the written documentation relating to this figure, especially the transcripts of the long trial wherein he was accused of publicly assaulting the apothecary Claude Sainte-Olive. Each document written in the French language of the time is presented with accompanying notes. A striking image of Montreal during this period (1700-1710) emerges from these sources.Distributed by the Institute. Please contact Brenda Dionne for purchase information.

Email: canadianartinstitute@concordia.caCold War-era imagery is defined by the striking contrast between the ideal of the nuclear family and the nightmare of nuclear annihilation. In 1963, Warren Langford, a Second World War air force veteran and career public servant, travelled through Europe, North America, and Africa as part of the National Defence College's curriculum of Cold War training. Langford, never before much interested in photography, bought a camera and produced some 200 slides of his travels. In A Cold War Tourist and His Camera, his art historian daughter and political scientist son bring his photographs - an unexpected combination of iconic images of Cold War dangers and touristic snapshots - back into view.Martha Langford and John Langford examine their father's apparently innocuous photographic experience, revealing the complexity of both the images and their creator. An intelligent and personal look at the ways that the historical and the private are represented and remembered, A Cold War Tourist and His Camera stages the family slide show as you've never seen it before.LINK TO PUBLISHER McGill-Queen's University PressThe Codex Canadensis is an illustrated manuscript about the flora, fauna and peoples of the New World. Produced ca.1700 and dedicated to King Louis XIV of France, the manuscript is located at the Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American Art and History in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Dr. Gagnon and a diverse team of specialists are studying the illustrations of the Codex Canadensis in relation to the Histoire naturelle des Indes occidentales written ca.1675 by Jesuit priest, Father Louis Nicolas. This project unites scholars in ethnographic, zoological, botanical, iconographical, classical and cultural studies and includes: Professor Nancy Senior, University of Saskatoon; Professor Emeritus C. Stuart Houston, University of Saskatoon; Henry M. Reeves, Oregon conservationist; Professor Réal Ouellet, Laval University; and Professor Emeritus Germaine Warkentin, University of Toronto. The Codex Canadiensis project is a detailed analysis of this treatise on the New World.LINK TO PUBLISHER McGill-Queen's University PressThis richly-illustrated catalogue was produced in conjunction with the exhibition of the same name, held in Bath, England in March 2011 and in Montreal, Canada, in March 2012. The subject of the exhibition is the “Suffragettes’ Wood,” a unique work of collective feminist landscape design, created on the outskirts of historic Bath between 1909 and 1912, at the height of the militant suffrage movement. Over sixty women visited Eagle House, a private home, to plant an evergreen tree or shrub in honour of the work they undertook for the right of all British women to vote. Destroyed in the 1960s to make way for a housing estate, the Suffragettes’ Wood lived on in a beautiful collection of more than 250 photographs. Hammond and Brown selected key images for the purposes of this exhibition in order to show how women came together in Edwardian England to make a safe, feminist space where they could both celebrate their achievements, and envision their trees growing into a better, more egalitarian future.LINK TO PUBLISHER Bath in TimeHeather Igloliorte. "We were so far away": Exhibiting Inuit Oral Histories of Residential Schools"Much of the literature on post-violent contexts addresses problems of transitional justice, memory studies, and post-conflict reconciliation. This volume inscribes an innovative domain of inquiry, situating itself creatively amidst these discussions but building upon the literatures of museum and heritage studies. The contributors (themselves practitioners, artists, curators, activists and academics) draw from a broad range of geographical and theoretical material, and explore new ways of bearing witness vis-a-vis curatorial practice, heritage work and memorializing the past, to examine the challenges and limitations of such endeavors.LINK TO PUBLISHER Palgrave MacmillanThe Visual Arts in Canada: The Twentieth Century charts the developments in Canadian art from the late-nineteenth century to the present with new essays by the country's leading art historians. A comprehensive overview, this volume embraces painting, sculpture, photography, design, video, and conceptual and cross-disciplinary art, as well as studies of art institutions and historiography. With such a remarkable scope, it is truly the first of its kind ever published. Each chapter explores the richness and diversity of Canadian art; topics range from impressionist painting to the multimedia work of First Nations artists, and from the Group of Seven to contemporary video production.Newly commissioned, carefully edited, and with 185 full-colour illustrations, The Visual Arts in Canada will appeal to general readers and students alike. An extensive index, as well as an appendix that list galleries and artist-run centres across the country, make this the definitive resource for Canadian art from the past century. 

Throughout the twenty chapters, readers will recognize favourite artists and encounter new ones - all of whom play an integral role in the country's visual history. 

The Visual Arts in Canada: The Twentieth Century demonstrates what makes Canadian art so visually compelling, so enduringly relevant, and so ripe for study.LINK TO PUBLISHER Oxford University PressThe Far Shore (1976), made under the direction of celebrated visual artist and experimental filmmaker Joyce Wieland, is one of Canada's most innovative contributions to cinema. The film borrows elements from the life of Canadian painter Tom Thomson, who is represented by the character of Tom McLeod. The main character, however, is not Tom, but the fictional creation of Eulalie de Chicoutimi, the married Québécoise woman who loves him. Using Eulalie's perspective, Wieland was able to re-frame Thomson's life and story as a romantic melodrama while infusing it with subversive commentary on gender, nature and nationalism, and ultimately, on the value of art.Here, Wieland specialist Johanne Sloan offers a fascinating new perspective on The Far Shore, making it more accessible by discussing Wieland's utopian fusion of art and politics, the importance of landscape within Canadian culture, and the on-going struggle over the meaning of the natural environment.LINK TO PUBLISHER University of Toronto PressHeather Igloliorte. "The Inuit of Our Imagination"A gorgeous retrospective on the transformation of Inuit art in the 20th century, mirroring the vast and poignant cultural changes in the North.In response to a rapidly changing Arctic environment, Inuit have had to cope with the transition from a traditional lifestyle to the disturbing realities of globalization and climate change. Inuit art in the latter half of the 20th century reflects the reciprocal stimulus of contact with Euro-Canadians and embodies the evolution of a modern Inuit aesthetic that springs from an ancient cultural context, creating an exciting new hybridized art form.LINK TO PUBLISHER Douglas & McIntyreElaine Cheasley Paterson. "Judy Chicago's Rainbow Shabbat at the MMAQ"Chicago in Glass/en Verre marks, after 28 years of absence, the return to Montreal of the world famous artist Judy Chicago.Many still remember her Dinner Party presented in 1982. This exhibition, still in the Top 5 of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Montreal, marked Quebec and participated in the feminist movement of the 1980s.This catalogue was produced for the exhibition Chicago in Glass/en Verre presented at the Musée des maîtres et artisans du Québec, from September 2, 2010 to January 9, 2011.LINK TO PUBLISHER Musée des maîtres et artisans du QuébecExpo 67, the world's fair held in Montreal during the summer of 1967, brought architecture, art, design, and technology together into a glittering modern package. Heralding the ideal city of the future to its visitors, the Expo site was perceived by critics as a laboratory for urban and architectural design as well as for cultural exchange, intended to enhance global understanding and international cooperation. This collection of essays brings new critical perspectives to Expo 67, an event that left behind a significant material and imaginative legacy.The contributors to this volume reflect a variety of interdisciplinary approaches and address Expo 67 across a broad spectrum ranging from architecture and film to more ephemeral markers such as postcards, menus, pavilion displays, or the uniforms of the hostesses employed on the site. Collectively, the essays explore issues of nationalism, the interplay of tradition and modernity, twentieth-century discourse about urban experience, and the enduring impact of Expo 67's technological experimentation. Expo 67: Not Just a Souvenir is a compelling examination of a world's fair that had a profound impact locally, nationally, and internationally.LINK TO PUBLISHER University of Toronto PressDepicting Canada’s Children is a critical analysis of the visual representation of Canadian children from the seventeenth century to the present. Recognizing the importance of methodological diversity, these essays discuss understandings of children and childhood derived from depictions across a wide range of media and contexts. But rather than simply examine images in formal settings, the authors take into account the components of the images and the role of image-making in everyday life. The contributors provide a close study of the evolution of the figure of the child and shed light on the defining role children have played in the history of Canada and our assumptions about them. Rather than offer comprehensive historical coverage, this collection is a catalyst for further study through case studies that endorse innovative scholarship. This book will be of interest to scholars in art history, Canadian history, visual culture, Canadian studies, and the history of children.LINK TO PUBLISHER Wilfrid Laurier University Press© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityPublicationsFaculty of Fine Arts
