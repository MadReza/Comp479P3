http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/chemistry/cbgrc/about.htmlThe CBGRC is a symposium that showcases graduate level work from universities across Quebec, Ontario, the Maritimes and the North-eastern United States. Now in its 19th year, the conference was founded on the idea of not only giving students the unique experience of presenting their research in a formal setting, but to provide ties between academia and industry.The conference has a competitive format where participants register in either the poster or oral presentations in English or French. Awards are presented for both oral and poster presentations. Students are judged based on quality and originality of their research.The competition is open to all students presenting research in the following categories:The event occurs during a single day. It includes a lunch and a wine & cheese. The symposium itself is open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to sit in during the lectures and take the time to observe the poster presentations. Poster and public-speaking presentations are graded by a panel of judges. These judges are volunteers and are either academic or industrial representatives. In the past, we have had judges representing institutions such as Concordia University, University of Montreal, McGill University, UQAM and companies. In addition, many of our sponsors are present at the conference. This allows students the chance to discuss research and inquire about potential job opportunities.For more information, contact Cindy Buonomano or Chris Liczner at:General information© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityAbout CBGRCChemistry and Biochemistry Graduate Research Conference
