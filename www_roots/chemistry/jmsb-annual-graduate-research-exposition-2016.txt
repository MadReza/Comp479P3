Posters will fill the atrium of the John Molson (MB) Building on Thursday, November 17, as 29 PhD and MSc students battle it out for cash prizes during the seventh Annual Graduate Research Exposition at Concordia.The event, which is open to the public, challenges graduate students from the John Molson School of Business (JMSB) to showcase their work in an appealing and easy-to-grasp poster format.Projects will be on display throughout the day, and students will be on hand from 4 to 5:30 p.m. to answer questions from inquisitive passersby.“A lot of modern-day issues students see in their textbooks or come across while browsing the internet will be brought to life during this event,” says Linda Dyer, chair and professor in the Department of Management and one of the exposition coordinators.Past research has touched on a breadth of topics — everything from the business relevance of planting trees in British Columbia, to the relationship between hockey and the stock market, to an analysis of coffee shop atmospherics.Dyer says it’s easy for grad students to get wrapped up in the scholarly nature of their topics and end up writing for experts only. “This event encourages them to focus on the applied nature of what they’re studying and its relevance to practice. So, no jargon.”The projects will be graded by a panel of judges, many of whom are prominent members of the Montreal business community.Researchers receive points for content, practical significance, aesthetics and explanation. Prizes, from $150 to more than $1,000, are presented at the end of the evening.All students who visit the expo can cast a vote for the Popular Choice/Best Communicator prize.“Many of those who have been judges come back in subsequent years because they really enjoy seeing what our students are doing.” 


 The Annual Graduate Research Exposition takes place on November 17 in the atrium of the John Molson (MB) Building (1450 Guy St.), Sir George Williams Campus.Find out more about John Molson School of Business graduate programs.
