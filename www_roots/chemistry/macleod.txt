Her research examines the social and cultural implications of the dissemination of early Canadian photography through two highly influential nineteenth-century illustrated periodicals: Canadian Illustrated News (1869-1883) and its French-language counterpart l’Opinion Publique (1870-1883).Michelle completed her MA at Ryerson University in Photographic Preservation & Collections Management. The resulting thesis in fulfillment of this degree is titled, “Defining a Research Tool: An Object-based Study of a Group of Inter-related Photographic Objects Attributed to the James Inglis Studio (1866 – 1884) in the McCord Museum, Montreal”. This work was the result of an internship at the McCord Museum and is intended to serve as a model for photographic and social historians when presented with inter-related, multi-part photographic objects. Michelle completed her BFA in Art History at Concordia University. She is delighted to be a part of Concordia’s vibrant Art History department again as a graduate student and part-time faculty. © Concordia UniversityAbout
