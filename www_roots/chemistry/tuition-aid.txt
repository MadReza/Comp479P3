In addition, the cost of living in Montreal is significantly lower than in most other large North American cities.The University reserves the right to modify the published tuition scale and other student fees, without prior notice, at any time before the beginning of an academic term.Full-time studentsPart-time students*approximate total program costsFor Canadian/Permanent Resident students onlyFull-time studentsPart-time students*approximate total program costsBeyond program costs (such as books, stationery and supplies), students should budget for living expenses of at least $12,000 CDN per year. This figure is based on the standard needs of a single person and includes accommodation, groceries, clothing, public transportation and miscellaneous expenditures. Under collaborative agreements sanctioned by the governments of Quebec and France, citizens of France qualify to pay Quebec tuition fees.The cost of books may vary significantly from one course to another. However, buying used books can significantly reduce this expense.
