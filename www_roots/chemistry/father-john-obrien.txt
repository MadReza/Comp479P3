O’Brien passed away in Pickering, Ont., on November 7, 2015. He was 91.Father O’Brien was a cherished Concordia professor and highly regarded author, speaker and administrator. In 1965 the Jesuit priest founded the Communication Arts program, the first university communication studies program in Canada, at Loyola College, one of Concordia’s founding institutions.
The two eulogies for Father O’Brien — professor emeritus at Concordia and founder of Canada's first Department of Communication Studies — were delivered at a memorial service on November 28. The euologies were by Donat Taddeo and Sandra Gabriele. Half a century ago Father John (Jack) O’Brien returned to Loyola College after five years at the University of Southern California, armed with a doctorate and a vision.To recognize Father O'Brien's exemplary career achievements, Concordia named him its first Distinguished Professor Emeritus in 1987 and bestowed upon him the Loyola Medal, one of the university’s highest honours, in 2011.With your support, we can preserve the legacy of a pioneer and encourage worthy students in financial need. Give to the Reverend Jack O’Brien, S.J., Bursary Endowment, online or by phone at 514-848-2424, ext. 3884, or toll free at 1-888-777-3330.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityRemembering Father John (Jack) E.
