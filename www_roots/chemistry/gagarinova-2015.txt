The use of bacterial model organisms was crucial for elucidating basic and universally conserved biological processes. However, despite research spanning decades, much still remains unknown about bacterial biology and pathogenesis, with bacterial pathogens continuing to pose threats to human health and claiming lives worldwide. Systems biology approaches are being applied in bacteria to drive discovery-based research and to fill in gaps left by other methods. I will describe the use of genetics and proteomics systems biology approaches for investigating bacterial protein synthesis and bacterial host manipulation strategies.Protein synthesis is a complex and conserved process, targeted by many antimicrobials. The mapping of genetic interactions between virtually all known or predicted translation-related genes of Escherichia coli in four conditions allowed to draw conclusions about the rewiring of genetic interactions in environmental adaptation and evolution. Furthermore, we were able to identify and independently verify functionally central and previously uncharacterized genes required for normal translation. The combination of genetic interaction and proteomics approaches further elucidated the role of one of these genes in ribosome biogenesis. Similarly, a combination of genomic and proteomic approaches is being used to examine bacterial host subversion mechanisms.The talk will discuss the findings from the aforementioned studies, demonstrating the breadth and depth of potential discoveries and applications as well as how the different approaches can be combined to produce even greater insights.Dr. Gagarinov is the guest of Dr. Dajana Vuckovic.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
