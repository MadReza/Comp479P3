Especially given the extreme impact of conflict and war on people all around the world, the theme of 'peace' is timely and important. Plus, it'll be fun!"Nuit blanche is an all-night celebration with 200 mostly free activities related to visual arts, cinema, poetry, storytelling, literature, dance, exhibitions, fantasy, comedy, musical performance, sports and theatre. The event is part of Montréal en Lumière, an annual festival that celebrates the performing arts and gastronomy across Montreal.Registered participants will begin with a quick tour of Renaissance and old masters’ works. Then they will roll up their sleeves for a hands-on workshop in which they'll create their own artworks inspired by the theme of peace.While participants get creative, the graduate students will be conducting informal interviews, asking questions to gain a deeper understanding of the various views and beliefs around modalities of peace.This collaboration between the university and the museum is the result of a partnership announced last fall that will see eight educational programs created by Concordia students in the Faculty of Fine Arts. They will be offered free of charge to the general public at the museum.
Register today to take part in Concordia’s Nuit blanche event at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts on Saturday, February 27, in the Jean-Noël Desmarais Pavilion. Two hour-long sessions are offered: at 6 and at 7 p.m.
