During the ten month internship at Queen’s Park, interns work for backbench Members of Provincial Parliament in both the opposition and government (roughly four months each). The interns are responsible for completing a variety of tasks for their Member, including helping draft Private Member’s Bills, writing speeches and questions, and assisting their constituents. The programme also offers an excellent opportunity for students to apply their academic knowledge in a practical fashion; interns research and write an academic paper about the Ontario legislature (with guidance from the programme’s academic director), and present their paper at the Canadian Political Science Association’s yearly conference. In recognition of their important role, interns receive a $21 000 stipend, and the opportunity to travel to various legislatures within and outside of Canada. Open to recent graduates of Canadian Universities.  Each application must be mailed to the programme office by January 31, 2017.  For more information, please contact the OLIP admin team at: admin@olipinterns.ca or visit: olipinterns.caSearch for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityOntario Legislature Internship ProgramDepartment of Political Science
