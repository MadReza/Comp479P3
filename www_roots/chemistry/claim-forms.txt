http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/students/international/health-insurance/claim-forms.htmlAs of January 26, 2015, all current international students who have a 7 digit ID# and who are covered with Blue Cross Health Insurance must remember to place a “2” at the beginning of their Blue Cross ID# when filing claim forms with Blue Cross. This will be the process as of January 26, 2015.For example, if a student has a Blue Cross Health insurance ID# of 9876543, as of January 26, 2015, their new Blue Cross Insurance ID# will be 29876543.All newly admitted students for Winter 2015 that were issued a Blue Cross card with an 8 digit ID# are asked to enter all 8 digits of the ID# when filing claim forms with Blue Cross. In order to properly be reimbursed for expenses from the Blue Cross Health Insurance Plan for International Students, you will be required to submit claim forms to Blue Cross. It is recommended that you keep blank claim forms to bring with you when you visit your Doctor. Ask the Doctor to complete the required information on the claim form.
If you require additional assistance in filling out a claim form please visit the ISO or attend a Health Insurance Information Session.
