http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/chemistry/2015/04/10/poulin-2015.htmlThe Conservation Science Division at the Canadian Conservation Institute undertakes analyses for museums, galleries, archives and cultural centres in Canada. In addition scientists work on applied research projects that often involve collaboration with external partners. The main objective of the CCI is to promote the proper care and conservation of Canada’s cultural heritage. This presentation will provide an overview of a research project on the characterisation of Canadian amber, and also share the results of two interesting and recent analyses of objects in Canadian collections.
Our interest in characterising amber stemmed from requests by archaeologists, who wanted to know if First Nations objects containing amber components found at sites across Canada might actually have originated elsewhere in Canada or Europe, thereby possibly demonstrating early trade of materials. Class Id amber is unique to Canada and has been identified in remote deposit sites in the Canadian high arctic. It has an interesting and important connection to well-known Baltic amber as it is the only other amber in the world to contain a significant abundance of succinic acid. Our research into the structural differences in amber from different deposit sites in Canada led us to uncover the first direct molecular evidence for succinic acid cross-linking of the polymer matrix of both Class Id Canadian amber and Baltic amber. Then, building on a novel pyrolysis technique, we uncovered exiting new evidence of cross-linking in another abundant class of amber, which has not been previously hypothesized. This important discovery may provide new insights into the strength and resilience of these remarkable resins, which have been able to survive for millions of years in harsh environmental conditions.
Analyses for museum clients are always varied and often extraordinary. In the second segment of the presentation, I will discuss two different projects: the identification of dyes on ancient burial cloths from Peru, and a case involving wooden African sculptures that began growing mysterious white efflorescence while in storage in Canada.Ms Poulin is the guest of Prof. Heidi Muchall© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
