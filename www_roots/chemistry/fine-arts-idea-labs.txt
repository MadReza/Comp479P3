Just as it sounds: an experimental forum in which to culture ideas about our unique Fine Arts Faculty culture.

How do we get a sense of ourselves?
What matters to us?
Where do we want the Faculty to go?

IdeaLabs will offer a flash of insight into some projects, program and potent ideas that are at play within our Faculty and through our alumni. Every month, beginning in October and ending in January, we will host IdeaLabs in four different university venues used by our faculty, staff and students.

Each Lab will be a two-hour session... First, an “idea slam” of super-fast presentations from at least ten different faculty, students, and alumni. Second, an unscripted discussion with presenters and all members of the audience moderated by jake moore.

IdeaLabs are meant to be micro and macro explorations of what we do as a Faculty and, more generally, where art, design, performance, pre-professional and scholarly activity in the cultural sphere may go in future.IdeaLabs are open to the whole Concordia community and to all friends-of-Fine-Arts in the public realm. First come, first seated.
