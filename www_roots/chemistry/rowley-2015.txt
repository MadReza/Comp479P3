http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/chemistry/2015/04/09/rowley-2015.htmlOur research group uses computer modelling to understand complex chemical processes. These processes can occur on length scales spanning from the picometer to the nanometer and time scales that span from the femtosecond to the microsecond, so we use special computational methods capable of describing systems that span these scales. In this talk, I will present three applications of these methods by our group. In the first example, we use polarizable molecular dynamics simulations to identify why the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide is able to permeate across cell membranes but water is not [1]. We have also used replica-exchange molecular dynamics and a coarse grain protein model to help elucidate the structure of a protein linked to a genetic disease. In the third example, we use the CHARMM-TURBOMOLE QM/MM program developed in our group [2] to determine why Zn(II) is more soluble in water than Mg(II), despite the fact that the ion-water distances are the same for both ions [3].[1] Riahi, S., Rowley, C.N.
