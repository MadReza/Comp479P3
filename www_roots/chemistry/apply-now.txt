http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/admissions/apply-now.htmlFollow our step-by-step guide to submitting an application for admission:You will begin by creating a Concordia Netname account. You can use your Netname to log back into the application if you need more than one session to complete it. We recommend you keep your email open in a separate tab or window to make the account verification process easier.
 If you have a Netname and have started an application, 
here you can complete your application and pay the $100 CAD application fee.
  If you have already paid your application fee, you can upload documents in the My Student Centre (log-in required).Take a few minutes to watch our admissions video to get familiar with the interface,
 a feel for all the steps and good advice.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityApply for admissionStep-by-step application guideBEFORE YOU START - Application tipsStart a new applicationContinue an applicationHow to apply for admissionTechnical supportConcordia University - Call us at 514-848-2424
