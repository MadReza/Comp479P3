http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/polisci/programs/undergraduate/co-op.htmlThe Political Science Co-operative Education (Co-op) program is an option for a limited number of full-time students entering the Political Science program.With the Political Science Co-op degree, students graduate with the equivalent of one year of full-time compensated employment related to their field of study and career objectives. While the Co-op degree is slightly longer (usually one semester) than the regular Political Science degree, the academic content of the Co-op program is identical to that of the regular degree. Most positions of employment are situated in the Montreal area; however, students who do not speak French must be prepared to work in other parts of Canada. Students can increase the diversity of employment options by applying to jobs across the country and international placements are also a possibility. For more information on the structure and expectations of the Co-op program, visit the students section of the Institute for Co-operative Education.Upon application to Concordia University, new students wishing to be considered for the Political Science Co-op program must indicate this in their application by ticking the co-op box when selecting their Political Science degree program.Current students must meet a GPA standard and a maximum credit requirement in order to be enrolled. Selected applicants may be interviewed or asked to provide a résumé and a statement including the reasons behind their interest in the Political Science Co-op degree.For further details about the GPA, credit, and application requirements for the Political Science Co-op program please visit the students section of the Institute for Co-operative Education or contact:Dr. Graham Dodds
