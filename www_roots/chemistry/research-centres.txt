http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/chemistry/research/research-centres.htmlWe share a building with Concordia's other experimental science departments: Biology, Physics, Psychology and Exercise Science which facilitates innovative collaborations.The Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry (CBAMS) was established at Concordia in June 2003 in recognition of the increasing importance of mass spectrometry in research in the molecular and life sciences.Housed in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, CBAMS takes a leading role in promoting research collaborations and in providing students with hands-on training in the applications of mass spectrometry to diverse problems in bioanalytical and biological chemistry, biogeochemistry, and the "omics" sciences.The Centre for NanoScience Research comprises faculty members from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Department of Physics and seeks to foster and promote interdisciplinary research collaborations in nanoscale science.The confluence of chemists, biochemists and physicists produces a rich interchange of ideas especially at the biochemical frontier.The Centre for Research in Molecular Modeling (CERMM) aims to create links between researchers in computational chemistry and biochemistry within and across institutions. One of its goals is also to provide an interdisciplinary forum for experimentalists and theoreticians to combine their expertise to model and understand natural phenomena at the molecular level.The Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics (CSFG) is located in the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex (SP Building) at Concordia University's beautiful Loyola Campus, located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The CSFG comprises of a dynamic, multi-disciplinary team of people, including biologists, biochemists and bioinformaticians. With the help of a $3 million CFI grant, a state-of-the-art core genomics facility has been assembled along with the computational resources necessary to sequence, process and store the genetic information of various organisms.Some of the major facilities accessible to researchers include our research centres; a laser spectroscopy laboratory; a nuclear magnetic resonance laboratory; and the Integrated Platform for Biomolecular Function, Interactions and Structure (BIOFINS) which is a biochemical spectroscopy laboratory including FTIR, fluorescence and CD spectrometers.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityResearch centresDepartment of Chemistry & Biochemistry
