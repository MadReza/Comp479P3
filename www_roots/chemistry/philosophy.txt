http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/philosophy.htmlPracticed and refined over thousands years, philosophy pursues the deepest questions—how to understand ourselves, how we know things, and how we should live. It teaches methods for analyzing and understanding complex, novel and persistent problems that we face in science, politics, economics, and cultural and human affairs. These questions demand creative and rigorous thinking that moves our world beyond current cycles of news, business, politics, and scientific discovery.
