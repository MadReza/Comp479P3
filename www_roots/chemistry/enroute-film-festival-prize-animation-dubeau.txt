Her film will be shown on Air Canada flights and screened theatrically in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.“What I really appreciate about the airplane screenings is that they reach people who might not go to an animation festival or a film festival. It broadens the reach,” says the 23-year-old, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in film animation from the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema.Her prize-winning film, Kaleidoscope, is about a character who finds a magic eye inside a fish. This new eye allows him to see the world as a more enticing place, full of colour and joy.The film had its world premiere this past summer during the 19th Fantasia International Film Festival.Dubeau says she hadn’t even considered a career in animation until she visited an open house for Film Production at Concordia.“Studying at Concordia ended up being a life-changing choice for me. After my first animation assignment, I was hooked,” says Dubeau. “Teachers like Luigi Allemano opened my eyes to the beauty of storytelling through moving images, and I learned the significant difference between being an animator and an artist who uses animation as their medium.”Dubeau’s next film will be an anti-fairytale, also in a surreal universe.“There is nothing that compares to the feeling of sharing a project you cherished and worked so hard on over the course of many, many months of production,” she says.
