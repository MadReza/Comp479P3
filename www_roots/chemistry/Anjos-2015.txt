http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/chemistry/2015/11/27/Anjos-2015.htmlCARTaGENE is the largest population cohort of Quebec. It is a genetic epidemiological  infrastructure consisting of a large databank and biobank, with regulatory oversight and governance. We have recruited 42 000 individuals, aged 40-69 years, representing 6 metropolitan regions of the province and collected detailed lifestyle, health and medical data on these individuals, and detailed physical measurements, clinical and biochemical measures at baseline. We have also collected whole blood, urine and have DNA and RNA available for the participants. The cohort is not disease-specific and captures a representative cross-section of the diseases  in the population. We have conducted detailed nutrition surveys on a subset of the participants and an environmental survey, which includes full residential information and 6-digit postal code resolution allowing for exposure assessments when linked to governmental databases for exposure.  Exploiting this data will enable the integration of gene by environment interactions to explain the etiology of chronic diseases. The sociodemographic  characteristics of the cohort are similar to those reported in the Census, with a slight skewing towards more educated participants. In addition, the prevalence of chronic, common diseases is comparable to that reported by Stats Can.CARTaGENE is the Quebec representative of  nation-wide cohort, the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Cohort (CPTP), which includes 5 regional cohorts (BC, Alberta, Ontario and the Atlantic provinces), with the aim of collecting  300 000 samples from the population.  CARTaGENE has been offering access to the data and biosamples since 2010 and offers open access, therefore no collaborations are needed.  More than 25 projects have been granted access in the last 5 years and some will be highlighted.Dr. Anjos obtained her Ph.D. from McGill University in Human Genetics with a focus on the Genetics of Type 1 Diabetes. She moved on to more translational research in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as part of her postdoctoral training. During this time, she developed a target identification program based on transcriptional signatures of small molecules as potential therapeutics in CF. This project included a unique collaboration between a large pharmaceutical company and an academic lab. She is now in charge of Data Access and Business Development at CARTaGENE and liaises extensively with potential cohort users, promotes the resource externally and is involved in strategic funding initiatives.She is the guest of Dr. Cerrie Rogers.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
