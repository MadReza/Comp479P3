At Concordia's Faculty of Fine Arts, we study, make, curate and exhibit contemporary art across all artistic disciplines. As one of Canada's largest fine arts faculties, our students have many opportunities to meet people from diverse backgrounds and explore new perspectives.  Our academic research pushes the boundaries of scholarly thought. We have arts-based research centres that focus on technology, media, creativity and human development. We are also a workshop for Montreal's cultural industries, with faculty who are active arts professionals, connecting us to the world. Open your eyes — and your mind. Concordia is a vital centre for the arts in Montreal. Find out how to take in the many talks, debates, exhibits, concerts and film screenings we host all year round. Tour our galleries, theatres and cinemas, and view creative works by faculty, students and visiting artists.Our spaces draw the attention of the local arts community and artists worldwide and create greater visibility for our students, who are gaining the skills to thrive in Quebec's vibrant and innovative performing arts culture.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityArts & culture hubStudy art
