http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/philosophy/student-life/grad-students.htmlThe Philosophy graduate students at Concordia publish the well known journal Gnosis and organize an annual conference. Their success in getting into doctoral programs of their choice or of finding jobs as well as the titles of their recent MA theses or research papers can be found under graduates & placements.Concordia's Graduate Philosophy Students' Association (GPSA) represents all Graduate Students in the Department of Philosophy in tandem with the University’s Graduate Student Association (GSA).  Being part of the GPSA is a great way to get involved, network, and socialize with other graduate philosophy students.  The GPSA members regularly meet to insure that the graduate students' interests and concerns are met.The GPSA's most significant activity is our annual conference held at the end of the winter term.  There are many ways to get involved with the conference and we would love to hear from you.  Getting involved is an enriching experience and you get to meet students from a wide range of departments from other universities, suggest speakers you really want to hear from, and familiarize yourself with conferences as an academic practiceFind out about past events that the GPSA has hosted and see our FaceBook page.Find graduate theses in SPECTRUM, Concordia's open access research repository.This list below includes Major Research Paper title (in quotation marks) or working topic areas; some students are in the process of deciding topics with their supervisor, so this is left blank.  For more on our graduate students, see our Academia.edu site, and also our list of students who have completed and graduated, with topics and placements.
