It creates an opportunity for graduate students in Art History to share and discuss their ideas with a wider Montreal audience, one that extends beyond the university.
 
Our first speakers will be Alice Michaud-Lapointe (PhD Student, Université de Montréal) presenting a paper entitled « L’archive fuyante : vérité et mensonge de la photographie documentaire chez Christian Boltanski », and Anne-Sophie Garcia (PhD student, McGill University) presenting a paper « Spectral Pasts and Historical Injustices in the Works of Alfredo Jaar and Oscar Muñoz» Mirna Boyadijan (PhD student, Université Paris 3) will chair the session.The evening will be followed by a reception where the conversation can continue in a more relaxed environment.For more information: http://conferences-hypotheses.org/
