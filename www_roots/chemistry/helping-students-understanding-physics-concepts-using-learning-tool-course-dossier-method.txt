It has also been used in regular physics courses. The course PHYS 200 (From particles to Galaxies) was offered for non-science students in the winter semester 2014 at Concordia University given by Dr. Calvin S. Kalman. Students were not required to do any mathematical problems in this course. How did students understand physics concepts without mathematics? The answer is ‘writing-to-learn’ methods. In this method students used different kinds of writing activities (during the course): writing reflections (before students came to class), concept writing- ‘Critiques’ (after class) and final essay writing (course dossier with six entries) at the end of the course in lieu of the final exam. Part of the Course Dossier Method is that students, who are not in the course, act as reviewers. Reviewers’ comments were helpful for the students taking the course as these comments enabled students to rethink about the materials. Many students have difficulty understanding concepts when they use traditional learning techniques. Comparing students’ earlier Critiques with later Critiques and also with students’ Course Dossiers, we found that that students’ general understanding of physics concepts improved.Ms. Wahidun Nahar Khanam, Department of Physics Concordia University© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
