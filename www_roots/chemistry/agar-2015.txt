We focused upon characterizing ALS-related modifications of SOD1 resulting from mutation and post-translational modification. Initial studies led to a structural and physicochemical model for familial ALS pathogensis; the discovery of prevalent post-translational modifications; and along with other groups, the discovery of amino acid residues that modulate survival of cellular models of disease. Armed with a better understanding of the structural determinants of ALS progression, we developed a novel chemistry, cyclic disulfide-mediated tethering of cysteine pairs, and identified compounds that could selectively stabilize SOD1 (ALS) or DJ1 (Parkinson) in vitro. The first compound tested in cells was surprisingly potent, leading to a cautious optimism for this class of compounds.Dr. Agar completed an undergraduate degree in Chemistry and Biochemistry from the University of Michigan, Flint; a Ph.D. under the direction of Michael Johnson at the University of Georgia; and Post-Doctoral studies at McGill's Montreal Neurological Institute under Heather Durham. He is the guest of Prof. Ann English.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
