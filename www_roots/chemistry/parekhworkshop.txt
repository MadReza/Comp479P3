He will elaborate on the ways in which liberal democracies, like Canada, can come to terms with the many pressures that face it, embracing diversity and the principles of pluralism as complements that allow such societies to cope with the diverse demands of future generations through stronger and more legitimate political systems.Registration for this workshop includes registration for the evening talk and reception on March 30th at 5:30pm.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
