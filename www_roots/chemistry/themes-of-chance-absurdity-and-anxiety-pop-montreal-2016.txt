At POP Montreal this year, it's a case of so many Concordians, so little time...This week, we're running a three-part "mini" series to cover as many as we can. This is Part III of our POP Montreal extravaganza; read Part I here and Part II here.
 At POP Montreal this Saturday, September 24 at 9 p.m. at Club Lambi.GG Love is a synth-pop trio comprised of bassist Michael Cota and Concordia students Georgia Graham and James Player on vocals, keyboards and guitar.The band launched their debut album, Looking Cool, last summer to critical acclaim. They followed it up with a Canadian tour and a playful, tongue-in-cheek video by music scene enfant terrible Jordan Minkoff (best known for last year’s Arcade Fire mockumentary, Playing With Fire).&amp;amp;nbsp;Released as a limited edition cassette, the band’s now sold-out album features hypnotic dance beats, shimmery synths and the soothing vocal stylings of Graham, its frontwoman.“My time lately has been spent at school, at work and writing songs at the studio,” says Graham, who studies photography at Concordia. She adds that balancing her school work with a music career can be challenging, but it’s also really helpful for staying focused and motivated.“I like having two main creative outlets because they influence each other both indirectly and directly. When I'm burnt out on one I turn my focus to the other. At school I'm given the opportunity to work on my own stuff while learning from the people around me which is so great.”Graham and her bandmates are currently hard at work on their next full-length album, which they hope to launch early next year.“GG Love is different in that it's very much a collaboration. I feel really lucky to be making music with James and Mich," Graham says "I've lived in Montreal for three years and I continue to be impressed by the creative energy of the people I've met, and their commitment to art and music. I've found the community to be very supportive."
 At POP Montreal this Saturday, September 24 at 9:30 p.m. at Barfly.High & Mighty is a recent transplant to Montreal’s music scene. Founded by Salt Spring Island natives Clayton and Jake Upex, the punk folk act is bolstered by local talents Ben Massicotte on guitar and Daniel Moscovitch (BA 08) on drums. The band’s heartwarming sound balances soulful nostalgia with inventive rock riffs.“High & Mighty is anything but, and everything still,” says Moscovitch, referring to the group’s desire to push genre boundaries.&amp;nbsp;Moscovitch says Concordia’s Department of Music provided him with crucial support early on in his career. “So many of us were given a chance to succeed and learn in the program when other schools weren’t necessarily willing to give us that chance,” he says. “I think because of that, many of us feel the need to pay that forward in our careers.”“Concordia also taught me to choose my partners and bandmates wisely, avoid negative egos and push the limits.”In recent years, Moscovitch has branched out into music production and band management.“I’m currently producing a full album with High & Mighty,” he says, “while mixing and producing records for various other artists and backing up various others on drums.”
