* Subject to some conditionsThe Chartered Professional Accountancy (CPA) Order was created in May 2012 following the unification of the accounting profession in Quebec. It results from a merger of the Ordre des comptables agréés (CA), the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités (CGA) and the Ordre des comptables en management accrédités (CMA). The Order thus represents all the areas of expertise of the profession—assurance, financial accounting, management and management accounting, finances and taxation —at the service of enterprises, organizations and the public.

The CPA Order comprises over 36,000 members and 7,000 future CPAs. By combining its distinctive forces under a single order, the Quebec accounting profession strengthens its position both nationally and internationally.
