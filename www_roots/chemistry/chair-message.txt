Our interdisciplinary faculty have international and national reputations as communications scholars and artists. The faculty regularly garners prestigious awards, grants and fellowships for our significant contributions to the fields of communications, media studies, cultural studies, media arts and design art.We pride ourselves in the strength and collegiality of our faculty and we have an excellent team of administrative, technical and teaching staff who make important contributions to life of the department. Our undergraduate and graduate programs explore a diverse range of approaches to media analysis, critique and media creation. Central to our programs of study is an integration of knowledge based in the humanities, liberal arts, social sciences and fine arts. Our students go on to become leaders in the media and cultural industries as well as respected scholars, researchers and artists. We have former graduates who are now Canada Research Chairs, and our students have been highly successful in receiving external research grants, including some of the most competitive in the country and beyond.Communication Studies is unique in its range of program offerings and we are well known for our exceptional students and the innovative work produced in this vibrant department.
