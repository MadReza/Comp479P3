Andrea FalconDavid Morrishttp://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/art-education/contact.htmlArt Education's administrative staff is the backbone of the department.Our unsung heroes are Department and Internship Coordinator Larissa Yousoubova and Department Assistant Stan Charbonneau.Larissa is the administrative manager of the department. She is a trained compliance auditor with post-graduate education in management (Reading University School of Business, UK). She has developed and delivered process management solutions in academic and corporate settings in six countries. Larissa's academic interests include cross-cultural communications and pragmatics of written discourse. She has worked towards her doctorate in communications at McGill."I'm the department assistant, and I mostly take care of the undergrads. Any type of question about the program, how to get into the program, issues about the program - I'm your guy. If I can't help the student, I'll get them in touch with the undergraduate advisor, or counseling and development, or student affairs... Whatever and whoever will help them get the answers they need.After having energetically served the Concordia community for decades as both Printing Estimator and Digital Store customer service representative, Stan joined the department of Art Education in late 2008. He has a deep love of paper and books, and brings with him an indefatigable sense of customer service. Stan's position focuses on the undergraduate academic programs offered by the department.

He will leap over tall buildings if required.
