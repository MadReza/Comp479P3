Magnan is an accounting professor at the John Molson School of Business and Stephen A. Jarislowsky Chair in Corporate Governance.An honourable mention went to another JMSB faculty member, Darlene Walsh. She is an associate professor in JMSB’s Department of Marketing.The CJAS is a multidisciplinary, peer-reviewed, international, quarterly journal that publishes manuscripts with a strong theoretical foundation in the areas of marketing, strategic management, international business, accounting, finance, organizational behavior and human resources management.Magnan’s paper, entitled “Disentangling CEO compensation: A simultaneous examination of time, industry, and firm-level effects” examines what drives CEO compensation in US corporations. Their results show that while cash salary is mostly driven by firm-specific factors, those same factors play only a limited role when it comes to equity-based compensation.The paper co-authored by Walsh, “Is ‘getting started’ an effective way for people to overcome the depletion effect?” probes the relationship between depletion and self-control.Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia University JMSB researchers win Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences awardsJohn Molson School of Business
