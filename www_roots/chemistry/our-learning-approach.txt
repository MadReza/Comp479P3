http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/applied-human-sciences/about/our-learning-approach.htmlThe educational philosophy of our department centers upon experienced-based learning, or learning-by-doing. Our courses stress real-life experiences with people, both inside and outside the classroom, and are integrated with relevant theory and research. This method gives students the best opportunities to put their learning into practice. Our teaching approach promotes the growth of knowledge and self-awareness.Students take responsibility for their own learning by trying out new approaches and opening themselves to understanding their impact on others. We have a team of faculty and staff from a wide variety of backgrounds including practitioners in the fields of adult education, communications, counseling, family life education, human relations, leisure sciences, psychology, social work, organizational and community development, and therapeutic recreation.© Concordia UniversityDepartment of Applied Human Sciences
