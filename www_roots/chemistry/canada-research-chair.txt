Since art is influenced by many different forms of experience, his interest is in interdisciplinary, intercultural, intermedia and interactive (Inter-X) approaches to art.Creative practice constantly evolves: composers make films, actors use wearable computers, artists design miming robots and traditional dancers compose real-time electronic music. In his well-equipped, state-of-the-art matralab (Music/Movement/Media Art Theatre/Theory Research Agency Laboratory), housed at Hexagram-Concordia, Professor Bhagwati studies and designs complex, pioneering art forms and strives to make them accessible to everyone.His research and collaborations with local and international artists include explorations of how sound moves in space (sound spatialization), altering sound with digital interfaces (using a digital wand), live performance interfacing with immersive technologies, and the merging traditional and digital art.Read Professor Bhagwati's biographyBhagwati's lab, matralab, is a research space dedicated to using interdisciplinary art practice to bridge the gap between art forms and to create a framework for theevaluation of intercultural, intermedia and interactive art. In addition to describing the lab's collaborative atmosphere, this video outlines one of the CRC's current projects - Musicking the Body Electric, or the ":body:suit:score" - a garment that serves as a score to musicians.Faculty of Fine Arts
