However, Co-op students alternate their academic semesters with off-campus paid work terms in government or industrial laboratories where they are employed as biochemists in-training.Work term note: With your employers permission, you may take a course during your work term as long as your GPA is above 3.00 Students who are above average academically, and interested in the Co-op Program should refer to the announcement in the Undergraduate Calendar.In order to be considered for the co-operative format, applicants must indicate that they wish to enrol in the Institute for Co-operative Education on the Concordia University Application Form.
