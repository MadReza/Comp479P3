http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/research/jarislowsky/research-and-resources/documentation-centre.htmlThe Institute’s Documentation Centre was created to collect and make accessible both printed materials and electronic media relating to Canadian art. The most extensive holdings in the Documentation Centre relate to the life and work of Paul-Émile Borduas. This collection contains files on each of his artworks, exhibition catalogues and invitations, critical writings, as well as a wealth of other archival materials. Also available is a collection of articles by the Montreal art critic and educator, Maurice Gagnon as well as materials relating to the Automatiste movement. These documents, many of which are unique, have been used for the compilation of Borduas’s catalogue raisonné, available on line at borduas.concordia.caIn addition to these holdings, the Documentation Centre houses recordings of lectures and symposia, as well as conference proceedings, from events organized with the support of the Jarislowsky Institute.
