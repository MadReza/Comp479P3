Responsible for the review of government legislation, private members’ bills and parliamentary committees on a variety of important topics, the Senate and its senators require a strong sense of confidence and independence in order to effectively perform their role. Recent changes to rules governing the Senate have also been put forth as well as the possibility of full Senate reform.Senator Joan Fraser, Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament also representing the province of Quebec and the Senatorial Division of De Lorimier, will be at Concordia on March 3rd for a one-day workshop exploring parliamentary reform. She will ask and seek to answer several important questions including whether we need parliamentary reform at all and what it would look like if it should happen.Don’t miss out, be part of this very important and timely discussion.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
