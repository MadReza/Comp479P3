http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/mechanical-industrial/facilities-services/research-labs/electrochemical-green-engineering-group.htmlOur research program is centered on modelling, engineering and technical use of gas evolving electrodes.At low current densities our particular research interest is on the hydrogen evolution reaction with the aim of engineering low cost and accessible platinum free electro-catalysts. At very high current densities, our theoretical work on the so-called glow discharge electrolysis, allowed us to develop a new route to synthesize nano-particles and to master glass micro-machining by electrochemical dischargesMost of our projects are driven by the aim to provide solutions to help reducing green-house gas emissions.Electro-Catalytic Green Engineering Group (EGE):
