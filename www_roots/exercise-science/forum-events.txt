We welcome your energy and enthusiasm!Our participation and support can take a variety of forms: providing access to space at the university or attending meetings to assist in event organization.In the past, we have collaborated by co-sponsoring events, endorsing a coalition, offering assistance in events planning, or providing space to a group to hold a press conference.The SdBI considers proposals for academic, community and student events. All proposals must be submitted to the Forum Committee, which meets monthly to assess proposals based on a number of factors including the event's relevance to the SdBI mandate.For more detailed information regarding proposal guidelines and eligibility, please consult our Sponsorship Policy. Questions and event proposals should be directed to the Events Coordinator.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversitySponsorship of eventsSimone de Beauvoir Institute
