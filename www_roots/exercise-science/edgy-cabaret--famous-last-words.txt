http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/sdbi/2016/03/05/edgy-cabaret--famous-last-words.htmlAfter 23 years of exploring the complexity of contemporary feminism, through fun, experimental, and community-building artistic events, Edgy Women/Redux is on its way out as 2016 marks the FINAL edition of Edgy activities at Studio 303. We know, right? We’re sad too! This last offering looks back on the festivals’ love of experimentation and thrill for emerging performance practices.

Featuring the highly anticipated return of killer EmCees Nathalie Claude and Dayna McLeod, this ultimate farewell edition of Cabaret Edgy offers a mix of six familiar and fresh-faced feminist performers. Alexis O’Hara, Alvis Parsley (TO), Claudia Chan Tak, Judy Virago (TO), Marie La Vierge, and T.L. Cowan (NYC) will guide you to the light at the end of the tunnel via eclectic explorations of the theme: The End. Enjoy a pre-show Edgy archive slide show, interact with the Edgy Oral History Project during intermission, and stay for a post-show dj dance party to die for!Facebook event: https://www.facebook.com/events/978523182214971/© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
