tribunal@alcor.concordia.caThe vast majority of hearings that take place result from accusations under the Academic Code of Conduct. Often, the offences and, therefore, the hearings, could have been avoided if the student was familiar with the rules and regulations pertaining to academic integrity.For this reason, we strongly recommend that every student take the time to review and understand these rules and regulations, the Academic Code of Conduct and to regularly consult the University academic integrity pages in order to remain current and aware of all rules, regulations and policies relating to academic integrity.Office of Student Tribunals
