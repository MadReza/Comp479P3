http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/calendar/current/encs/mechindu.htmlSee the description of the Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy requirements in the general section on the Faculty of Engineering and Computer ScienceThe Department offers two 45-credit programs leading to MASc or MEng degrees in Mechanical Engineering.Requirements for the DegreeThe requirements described here are in addition to the general degree requirements for the Master’s Programs in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer ScienceStudents must complete 45 credits as shown below:TopStudents may specialize in one of the following branches: a. Industrial Control Systems; b. Materials and Composites; c. Mechanical Systems; d. Thermofluid Engineering. Students must complete 45 credits in courses. Courses must be selected as follows:‡ Students must obtain approval from the Aerospace Program Director for all the courses listed in topic area E11.TopAdmission Requirements. Applicants must hold a Bachelor’s degree in engineering or equivalent with high standing. For further details, refer to the section Admission Requirements for Master of/Magisteriate in Engineering in the appropriate pages of the graduate calendar.Requirements for the DegreeStudents must complete a minimum of 45 credits of academic work consisting of: 36 credits of course work in the 6000 or 7000 level (2 courses must be taken outside Concordia), Aerospace Case Study (minimum 3 credits) and an Industrial Stage (6 credits). The selection of courses must be approved by the program director. For course prerequisites, refer to the course descriptions.Note: Some graduate courses are content equivalent with specified undergraduate courses. These courses are not available for credit to students who have completed the undergraduate equivalent. Refer to the course description where such courses are marked with an (*).General/Preparatory Core Courses. Normally, 12 credits are required to be completed from the list provided below. Any request for change on this requirement must be approved by the program director. Depending on the background, it may be required for the student to complete certain specified preparatory courses as part of their program.Specialization Courses. 24 credits are to be completed from the specialization courses in one or more of the areas listed below. For other courses available from the participating universities, consult their listings.Students should consult the program director at their home university for the selection of courses to suit their area of specialization and need not confine their choice to any one area. A minimum of two courses are to be taken outside of Concordia (minimum 3 credits per course), at least one each from any two of the participating universities. Courses must be chosen from the equivalent Master of Aerospace Engineering program of the participating universities. For courses available from the participating universities, consult their listings and request permission for limited enrolment courses. A second Aerospace Case Study course may be considered as a specialization course.ENGR 6251, 6261; MECH 6081, 6111, 6121, 6161, 6171, 6191, 6231, 6241.COEN 6711; ENCS 6161; ELEC 6121, 6141, 6301, 6351, 6361, 6381, 6601, 6881;

ENGR 7961 Industrial Stage and Training (6 credits)Prerequisite: Completion of at least twelve credits in the composite option and at least twenty-one credits in the aerospace program or permission of program director.
This is an integral component of the aerospace program in the Mechanical Engineering program that is to be completed under the supervision of an experienced engineer in the facilities of a participating company (Canadian work permit is required). The topic is to be decided by a mutual agreement between the student, the participating company and the program director. The course is graded on the basis of the student’s performance during the work period, which includes a technical report.There may be some restrictions placed on students chosen for the industry sponsored “stage”. For those students who are unable to obtain an industrial stage, it is possible to take ENGR 7961 for a project carried out at the university. Such students must obtain the approval of the program director. Career Prospects. In Montreal, graduates have found work in companies such as Pratt & Whitney Canada, Bell Helicopter, CAE Electronics, Bombardier Aerospace, and others. They hold positions as varied as consulting engineers, aircraft designers, manufacturing plant managers, vice presidents, and chief executive officers. Some have also gone on to form their own companies, while others have taken jobs across Canada and abroad. A number of our graduates hold teaching positions in several universities across North America and in other countries.TopAdmission Requirements. Applicants to the program must hold a bachelor’s degree in engineering with above-average standing. The Faculty Graduate Studies Committee will determine the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require the applicant to do specific remedial course work to meet the program requirements.Requirements for CompletionThe Graduate Certificate program can be completed in one to three years. Students with high standing in their Bachelor’s program and whose academic records satisfy the requirements for Good Standing in the Master’s program in Mechanical Engineering (see Engineering Programs section) may apply for transfer to the Master’s program.CoursesAll courses are 4-credits.
