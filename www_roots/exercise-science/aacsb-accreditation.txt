Ours was the first in Montreal to receive accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), thus ranking it among other leading business schools such as Harvard, Wharton, and Northwestern. JMSB was the fourth business school in Canada to receive this prestigious seal of excellence.

We are pleased to say that AACSB International’s high standards have helped us to achieve our goal of offering students a dynamic, contemporary, and relevant business curriculum.
