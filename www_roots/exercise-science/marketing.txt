http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/co-op/marketing.htmlEstablished in 1995, the Marketing Co-op Program has grown to become one of the largest in the university. Our graduates have gone on to successful careers in such areas as product management, advertising, public relations, sales, event management, fundraising, fashion, direct marketing and online marketing. Many have become entrepreneurs and have launched their own enterprises. What is particularly rewarding is that former Marketing Co-op students consistently hire current Marketing Co-op students for co-op work terms.
The field of marketing is one of the most diverse in the business world and our Marketing Co-op work terms certainly reflect this diversity.Recent work terms include placement in the following areas:“This work term has helped me clarify and redefine my career goals. It allowed me to grow personally, with my confidence, as well as professionally, in managing tasks and team communication. I had the privilege to work with great mentors as well as open-minded individuals within the company.” 
Edouard Hon Tse – Bombardier Aerospace

“Overall, my experience at Genetec was an educational one and a great introduction to what working for a large organization looks like and I am proud to say that they have hired me for a part-time position during the fall semester.”
Michelle Dansereau – Genetec

"I underestimated just how much I would learn and just how diverse the knowledge and set of responsibilities I got to experience first handedly. My internship at Beiersdorf was one of the best choices I have ever made.”

Methodological and review articles will also be discussed. The focus on the seminar is the subset of human behaviour related to the consumption and/or use of goods and services, as well as the processes that lead up to them. Major emphasis will be placed on marketing communication, attitude development and attitude change, information processing, decision-making processes and strategies, as well as the post-purchase process including new findings in the areas of consumer satisfaction and cognitive dissonance.This seminar will focus on the communication process between a company and its markets and other publics. Theories, findings, hypotheses and techniques from several disciplines, such as social psychology, sociology, political science and marketing, will be studied and evaluated in the context of the design, planning and control of marketing communications programs. More emphasis will be given to advertising decisions than to personal communications decisions.This seminar acquaints students with well-known approaches to managerial decision-making and research in the area of Product Innovation and New Product Marketing. Analytical approaches presented in recent publications, combined with some important "classics", will be stressed. The course focuses primarily on new product development/marketing and covers a variety of topics, strategies, phases and analytical approaches relevant to this subject area. Specific topic areas include: innovation and new product development (NPD) strategies, the stages of the NPD process, new service development, and organization for NPD.One of the most pervasive actions that humans engage in is making decisions. Individuals choose which products to purchase, universities to attend, careers to pursue, mates to marry, among countless other decisions that they will make in their lifetimes. How does a consumer decide which product to purchase? How much information will an executive use prior to deciding whether to launch or abort a new product? What are the attributes that men and women look for in their ideal mates? How do individuals allocate their gift giving expenditures to the various recipients? The purpose of this course will be to introduce the student to two areas of inquiry that can help us understanding how individuals make decisions. The first part of the course will focus on the vast behavioral literature in judgment and decision making in an attempt to better understand how individuals arrive at a final judgment and/or choice. The second part of the course will shift focus to a recently developed Darwinian framework namely evolutionary psychology, to show that many behaviors, cognitions, emotions, preferences, and choices that we make are steeped in our Darwinian heritage.Segmentation and positioning are two of the most critical strategic choices in marketing. This course focuses on some statistical models that are used often by researchers in segmentation and positioning. Collectively, these tools aim to (1) understand the nature of consumer perceptions and preferences and (2) examine if they are homogeneous across groups of buyers. The models to be covered include factor analysis, deterministic and probabilistic multidimensional scaling, correspondence analysis, internal and external analysis of preferences, conjoint analysis and various types of cluster analysis. In addition to providing an understanding of the statistical foundations of these popular models in marketing research, the course will expose the students to "hands-on" data analysis through assignments that require the use of statistical software such as BMDP, SPSS, SAS, and other software shared by researchers and academicians.This specialized MSc seminar in marketing emphasizes theoretical and methodological knowledge necessary to conduct marketing research in a retailing context and is targeted toward MSc students who consider working (1) in retail management, (2) in marketing research, or (3) as consultants in the retail sector. The first half of the seminar emphasizes research on retail consumers and their responses to retail environments and retail offerings. The second half of the seminar focuses on strategic issues in retailing, such as pricing, sales promotions, and loyalty programs.This specialized MSc course in marketing aims at providing graduate students in marketing with an in-depth knowledge of consumer, organizational, and societal perspectives on brand management. The first half of the course emphasizes the cultural, personal, and interpersonal meaning of brands, and includes a discussion of the meaning of possessions, sacred and ritual brand experiences, and the role of nostalgia in shaping the meaning of brands. The second half of the course focuses on managerial aspects of branding, such as brand equity, brand extensions, and the elements of the brand mix.This seminar is designed to introduce students to several multivariate analysis techniques with emphasis on the practical use of these tools in business research. Techniques that will be covered in this course include MANOVA, discriminant analysis, principal components and factor analysis, canonical correlation analysis and multidimensional scaling. The objective of the seminar is to provide a fundamental understanding of the nature, power, and the limitations of multivariate statistical techniques.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityMarketingJohn Molson School of Business
