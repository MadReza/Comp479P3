Specifically, you should keep three things in mind:We consider complete applications year round and we give priority to applicants who apply by official deadlines. Late applications will be considered if places are still available for the fall term only.We reserve the right to close admission to a program at any time after the official deadline without prior notice.
 Many programs have departmental requirements that you must satisfy in addition to Concordia’s minimum admission requirements. Additional requirements might include:You must make arrangements to submit these additional requirements with the department you apply to. Please consult the specific program page for more information on these requirements.
 If you complete your application by the appropriate deadline, you can expect to receive a decision according to the timetable below. The assessment period for late applications for some programs may be ongoing until the start of term. This may not apply to programs with additional requirements such as a portfolio, interviews or auditions.
