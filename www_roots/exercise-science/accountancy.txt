http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/co-op/accountancy.htmlThe Accountancy Co-op program was introduced in September 1993. Accountancy Co-op students receive valuable, practical, paid work experience that provides the link between academic and the real business world. The program has proven to be a success and many of our students pursue a professional designation - Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA)."I appreciate the fact that they fully utilized us to our potential and gave us a lot of responsibilities ."
— Natasha Siao Vee Sin,  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP"I would definitely recommend every student to apply for a co-op program. It is the perfect way to prepare a student to the real world and even to make sure they are in the right field. I personally realized through my work terms that I made the right decision as to my career. Doing well in a certain subject at school does not necessarily mean you would love the job associated with it." 
— Tam Mach,  KPMGCo-op gave me the opportunity to work and network with amazing leaders… Added value to my university experience… Prepared me for my future career and endeavors… Gained a lot by making the wise decision of joining the Institute for Co-operative Education.”
