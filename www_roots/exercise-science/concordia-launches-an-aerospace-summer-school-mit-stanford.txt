Keen to learn about drone navigation and robot motion planning? Or aircraft design?These are just a few of the lofty topics covered by Aerospace Summer School, Concordia’s new four-day program for industry professionals and graduate students.Running from June 27 to 30, it features an all-star line up of guest lecturers, including Jonathan P. How from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as Juan J. Alonso and Marco Pavone from Stanford University.“We’re offering participants an enriched educational experience by providing access to experts in the field, who come from top academic institutions and industry,” says Luis Rodrigues, associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and faculty advisor for UAV Concordia, the undergraduate unmanned aerial vehicle society.Rodrigues and Nadia Bhuiyan, professor and associate director of the Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation (CIADI), created the summer school’s scientific program, secured academic lecturers and industry partners.Attendees will get to go on site visits to local aerospace businesses, including Bombardier.“An event like this puts Concordia on the map, and it attracts foreign students to do their master’s degrees here,” says Rodrigues, who notes that the first cohort of students in Concordia’s new aerospace undergraduate degree start in September 2016. The summer school is a joint initiative between the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science and the Centre for Continuing Education (CCE).“It’s a great opportunity for Continuing Education to bring our talent and resources to support a project that will leverage Concordia’s reputation in this highly specialized domain,” says Isabel Dunnigan, director of the CCE, which handled logistics and promotion for the summer school.“We have a new and more agile structure, which will allow us to pursue more partnerships with faculties. That’s our aim.”
