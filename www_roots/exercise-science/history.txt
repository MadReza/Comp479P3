http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/sdbi/about/history.htmlThe Simone de Beauvoir Institute, a college within Concordia University, was established in 1978 to provide a foundation for the interdisciplinary teaching of, and research in, Women’s Studies. Beauvoir, a distinguished philosopher and feminist writer, authorized the Institute to use her name and continued to show great interest in its activities. The SdBI has been a pioneer in the field of Women’s Studies in Canada.Here is a timeline with significant events in the development and life of the SdBI.Greta Nemiroff and Christine Allen Garside (later Sister Prudence Allen) begin teaching the course The Nature of Woman in the Sir George Williams University Philosophy Department. In 1972, the course is divided into two courses on “The Nature of Woman”: Historic Attitudes and Recent Approaches.Margaret Anderson (from the Loyola College French Department) teaches an Interdisciplinary Studies course, Social Change, Women in Modern Society.  Katherine Waters begins teaching the course Women and Literature in the English Department at Loyola College. J. Tarlo teaches The Sociology of Women in the Sociology Department and M. Porter teaches History of Women in the History Department. Other Women’s Studies courses quickly follow in other disciplines.Susan Hoecker-Drysdale (from the Department of Sociology) is the organizer of a Women’s Studies Concentration within the Interdisciplinary Programme of the Loyola Faculty of Arts & Science. Hoecker-Drysdale is named Co-ordinator of Women’s Studies in 1974-75.Women's Studies becomes a programme within the newly-formed Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in the Sir George Williams University (SGW) Faculty of Arts. The SGW Women's Studies Committee is formed and Vivienne Walters is named Coordinator of Women’s Studies. A joint major in Women’s Studies is introduced in 1974-75; this disappears in 1975-76, to be replaced by a minor in Women’s Studies. In August 1974, Concordia University is created as a result from the merger of Loyola and SGW.Despite the merger, activities still take place on two campuses. The SGW Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies offers a minor in Women’s Studies (Vivienne Walters is Coordinator until Christine Allen replaces her in 1977) and the Loyola Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies offers a minor in Women’s Studies (Susan Drysdale is Co-ordinator until Allannah Furlong replaces her in 1976). In March 1977, a Women's College Committee is formed and starts working on a proposal. The Committee is co-coordinated by Christine Allen and Allannah Furlong, and includes faculty, students and staff from both campuses as well as individuals from other Montreal institutions and community organizations. On December 20, 1977 the Committee makes a formal submission to the Concordia Senate for the establishment of a Women’s College.Principal Maïr Verthuy and Professor Patricia Morley organize the first Canadian national conference on Women’s Studies, Parlons-en/Talking Together.Principal Maïr Verthuy, with the help of many students and faculty, organizes a 10-day international conference on teaching and research related to women. Participants from more than 80 countries are involved. A group of First Nations women organize an evening featuring a film by Alanis Obomsawin, the well-known Abenaki film director.The SdBI offers the first Lesbian Studies course at any Canadian university. The course is taught by Yvonne Klein as part of the summer session.Regular meetings of the Lesbian Studies Coalition of Concordia take place in the SdBI lounge. These meetings honour the history of the SdBI building, which used to house Madame Arthur’s (1973-1975), a lesbian bar.The SdBI sponsors When Sex Works/Quand le sexe travaille, an international conference on sex work and prostitution that includes the voices of women working in the industry. This sponsorship is in line with the history of the SdBI building, which was reportedly once a brothel.Lillian Robinson begins her term as SdBI Principal. Under her leadership, the dynamism and visibility of the SdBI continue to thrive.SdBI Principal Lillian Robinson captures the hearts and emotions of all, notably in her performance of a Concordia staging of The Vagina Monologues.Ashanti Alston, former member of the Black Panthers, is invited to speak on “Counter-Power: The Black Panther Party Experience.”The SdBI produces “Reasonable Accommodations – A Feminist Response.” This statement, produced collectively and involving students, faculty and staff, raises critical questions about the framing of the “reasonable accommodation” debate in Quebec.Geneviève Rail is hired as the new SdBI Principal, bringing with her a wealth of research and administrative experience from the University of Ottawa.Here is the list of those who have been Principal of the SdBI so far.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityHistorySimone de Beauvoir Institute
