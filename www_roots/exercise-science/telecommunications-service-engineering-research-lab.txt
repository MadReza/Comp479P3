http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/info-systems-eng/facilities-services/research-labs/telecommunications-service-engineering-research-lab.htmlService engineering is the discipline that addresses the technologies and engineering processes for the specification, implementation, testing, deployment, usage of value added services in telecommunication networks.Value added services, or more simply services, can be defined as anything that goes beyond two party voice calls. They are either call related (e.g. call diversion, multiparty gaming, conducted conferences) or non-call related (e.g. customized stock quotes, Web surfing from a cellular phone). Some services may combine call related and non-call related features (e.g. call centers).Services are the reason of next generation telecommunication networks. This gives a strategic importance to service engineering. However, there are still very few research laboratories in academia focusing on service engineering. The Telecommunications Service Engineering (TSE) Lab is among these few laboratories. It has been created in January 2003 as part the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering (CIISE).Telecommunications Service
