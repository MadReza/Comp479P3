Our programs give you the professional knowledge and skills to interpret, apply and conduct health science research. You learn to assess, evaluate and design programs that can maintain and improve health, fitness and athletic performance.Through lectures, hands-on lab instruction and internships, you practise clinical skills related to rehabilitation, and the improvement or maintenance of personal health. Working in small groups and using state-of-the-art facilities, you study a range of people, from individuals suffering from chronic disease to elite athletes.Our department offers you three options to specialize in:Whatever option you choose, you will graduate with an applied knowledge of health science that focuses on health and fitness.A Bachelor of Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background.Options:ConcentrationsStudents may apply for a transfer to Specialization after having completed certain courses and obtained a Grade Point Average of 3.0.Minimum cut-off averages should be used as indicators. The cut-off data may change depending on the applicant pool. Applicants who meet the stated minimum requirements are not guaranteed admission to these programs.Make sure you also meet Concordia’s minimum admission requirements.We consider complete applications year round and we give priority to applicants who apply by official deadlines.
