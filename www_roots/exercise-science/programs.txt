The primary purpose of a Minor in Sustainability Studies is to enable students to complement their Specialization, Major, or Honours program with the systematic development of literacy in sustainability. Students will learn to situate the knowledge they gain from other disciplines within the context of complex global and local issues, such as biodiversity loss, or social injustice, while gaining a sophisticated understanding of the specific ways in which such issues interact directly with their chosen field of study. Students will also have the opportunity to contribute directly to the pursuit of sustainability through internship and research opportunities on campus and in the outside community. Courses include Biodiversity and Ecology, Current Issues in Personal and Community Health, and Economics of the Environment.
The Minor in Israel Studies is a 24-credit program intended for undergraduate students in the Faculty of Arts and Science who wish to complement their core area of study with a selection of courses on Israel. The program is designed to equip students with the skills to engage in a balanced, critical and reflective approach to the study of Israel, a land of competing narratives, aspirations and claims. The minor offers courses in the following areas: Languages (Hebrew and Arabic); Politics and Religion in Israel; Israel and the Middle East; and a range of electives including Women in Israel and Studies in Near Eastern Art and Architecture. With a fifth of the world's population, one of the world's oldest civilizations, and an immense political and religious sway, Southern Asia affects our lives every day. When you look at the social and cultural systems of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, or examine religions such as Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism or Jainism, you learn how to relate to the world, an essential education for today’s world.  To study the customs, social organization, ideas, history and present-day conditions in Southern Asia you must take courses from a range of disciplines: religion, history, political science, film studies, economics, English, and sociology and anthropology.Our program allows you to focus on your interests. You might connect with your heritage, study an element of contemporary religion or society, or acquaint yourself with an ancient culture. Either way, you’ll leave us with well-developed insights into the art of intercultural dialogue, and expert knowledge of Southern Asia’s important contributions to the world.    The Department of Religion offers a 42-credit Major and a 24-credit Minor in Southern Asia Studies.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityInterdisciplinary programsFaculty of Arts and Science
