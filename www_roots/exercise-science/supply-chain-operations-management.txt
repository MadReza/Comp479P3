http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/co-op/supply-chain-operations-management.htmlIn today’s global economy, companies spend billions of dollars in procurement, transportation, manufacturing, distribution and finally meeting customer’s product/service needs. These supply chain processes are extensive and span across companies and continents around the globe.

Supply Chain Operations Management (SCOM) is all about the coordination and integration of these entities via system-wide thinking.

The program aims to develop well-rounded business leaders with proficiency in both problem solving and change management leadership, which are skills suited in a wide variety of industries, including consulting, manufacturing, retail, logistics, distribution and software.
"Facing today’s increasing global competition and the finance crisis, supply chain management is becoming more and more critical to international companies like Siemens. In Siemens, Supply Chain Management Initiatives will generate substantial additional value and accelerate the establishment of a world-class SCOM function within the sectors and the company. Being an outstanding student majoring in SCOM with adequate experiences, I applied for a Supply Chain Management position in Siemens and finally got the offer. Presently, I am contributing what I learned to the company and growing with Siemens."
