http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/main/stories/2016/11/29/health-benefits-rate-for-cupfa-and-cuceptfu-2016-2017.htmlEach benefit year (September 1 – August 31), the cost of insurance coverage under the Concordia Health Plan for employees who are members of CUPFA and CUCEPTFU is reviewed and premium rates for the following benefit year are determined. The rates are primarily based on past use of the benefit by the participants in the plan.In August 2016, you were notified that the premium rates for the 2016-2017 benefit year would be increasing, for the first time in four (4) years, by 20%.At its November 2016 meeting, the Board of Governors approved a motion that the University will absorb the cost of the increase to Health Plan premiums for the 2016-2017 benefit year.The change in the premium rates will be implemented on pay issued December 9, 2016. This means that those who have not paid the 2016-2017 premium rates in full will see a reduction in the rates for the balance of the year. For those who have paid in full, either through payroll deduction or by cheque, they will have the amount equal to the incremental increase in the health plan premium reimbursed on pay issued December 9, 2016.Please bear in mind that in accordance with taxation laws, health plan premiums paid by the employer are taxable benefits. The incremental cost of the health care premiums absorbed by the University for the 2016-2017 benefit year will be an additional taxable benefit for employees. This additional amount will be included on the tax slips for 2016.For questions related to health benefits, please contact Human Resources at: 514-848-2424 ext. 3666 or at: benefits@concordia.ca
