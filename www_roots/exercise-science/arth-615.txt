http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/art-history/programs/graduate/art-history-ma/seminars/arth-615.htmlThis course will examine postcolonial and Indigenous art theories and methods for the study of art history in a North American context. In this course students will be introduced to the key texts, authors, concepts and themes at the intersection of Indigenous and postcolonial theory and criticism, such as race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, diaspora, identity, gender, authenticity, hybridity, culture, critical museology, tradition, sovereignty, self-determination, resistance and resilience. We will trace the history and development of these art theories and methodologies as rooted in postcolonial thought and specific Indigenous cultural worldviews, teachings, and knowledges, focusing on the mid-twentieth century to the present. In this class students will cultivate an understanding of colonization relative to the Western art world, the critique of colonial power structures, the aftermath of colonialism on global Indigenous and non-Western peoples, and the ongoing processes of decolonization and (often hidden) neo or settler colonialism in the present. In this course, students will examine key texts that enhance our understanding of postcolonial and Indigenous theory and criticism in the contexts of public scholarship, art, artists, exhibits and institutions.
