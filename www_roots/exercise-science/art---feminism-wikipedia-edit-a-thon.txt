Facebook event: https://www.facebook.com/events/217844895222793/Art+Feminism is a rhizomatic campaign to improve coverage of women and the arts on Wikipedia, and to encourage female editorship. Wikipedia's gender trouble is well documented. In a 2011 survey, Wikimedia found that less than 13% of its contributors are female. The reasons for the gender gap are up for debate: suggestions include leisure inequality, how gender socialization shapes public comportment, and the contentious nature of Wikipedia's talk pages. The practical effect of this disparity, however, is not. Content is skewed by the lack of female participation. Many articles on notable women in history and art are absent on Wikipedia. We invite people of all gender identities and expressions, particularly trans- and cis-gendered women, to address this absence by organizing in-person, communal updating of Wikipedia’s entries on art and feminism.Anne Goldenberg will offer a workshop on anti oppressive approaches to Wikipedia. Anne Goldenberg is interested in political, epistemic and poetic platforms both collaborative and participative. She has a PhD in Communications (UQAM, Montreal) and Sociology (UNice, Nice) and wrote her thesis on "the negotiation of contributions in public wikis."Notes on accessibility:
