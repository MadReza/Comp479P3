Industrial engineers are experts in optimization who apply mathematics, engineering and psychological principles to improve productivity, safety and quality. A knack for project management can lead to a career in many different economic sectors.In the Engineering Design and Manufacturing and Computer Integrated Manufacturing labs, you’ll get practical experience with the tools and equipment you may use in the field. Through labs, lectures and projects, you’ll also:Our program is accredited by Engineers Canada and you’ll graduate eligible to become a registered professional engineer.A Bachelor of Engineering degree takes a minimum of four years (120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background.Read more about the Industrial Engineering options.Applicants who do not meet the minimum requirements or with partial prerequisites are encouraged to apply and will be reviewed holistically. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program.Admission is based on applicants' overall CRC, including above-average grades in mathematics and physics, and completion of the following classes as part of their DEC.

Prerequisites for all BEng programs and the BCompSc Computer Systems Option:
 CHEM 101 or 202-NYA; MATH 103 or 201-NYA and 203 or 201-NYB and 105 or 201-NYC; PHYS 101 or 203 NYA and 201 or 203 NYB

Cegep applicants completing a three-year technical DEC in a related field are eligible for admission if they meet the overall CRC requirements. Missing prerequisites will be added to their program. Students may be eligible for exemptions/transfer credits based on course equivalencies.Prerequisites for all BEng programs and the BCompSc Computer Systems Option: Calculus I and II, Linear Algebra, Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, General Chemistry I

Transfer credits may be considered on a course‑by‑course basis.Students will be assessed according to their educational background. Some or all prerequisites will be added to the program at Concordia. IB Standard Level courses (SL) are not eligible for exemptions. Students from Bacc. Français schools with Série ES may be considered for admission to some programs.Prerequisites for all BEng programs and the BCompSc Computer Systems Option: Math and Physics (Chemistry if Physics not offered)Engineering students are able to add a minor in another discipline once they have completed at least 21 credits and if they maintain a GPA of 2.70.
