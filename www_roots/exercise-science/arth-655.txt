http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/art-history/programs/graduate/art-history-ma/seminars/arth-655.htmlThe Thesis Seminar, led by the Graduate Program Director, is a mandatory course for all incoming MA students.  This seminar is designed to introduce students to the intellectual and professional aspects of graduate school and academia.  Students will receive guidance about the sequence and stages of graduate study, including the thesis proposal, conducting research and interviews, the "Annotated Review of Sources and Documents," and the thesis itself.  The seminar also provides information on other aspects of academic life, such as giving conference papers, getting published, and applying for grants.  

The Thesis Seminar runs for approximately the first half of the fall term, and then resumes in January, running for the first part of the Winter term.  There is no formal registration for this course (thus, it will not immediately appear on your transcript); rather, students receive a PASS/FAIL notation on their transcripts under ARTH 655 once they have participated in the "thesis presentation" during their second year in the program. © Concordia UniversityAbout
