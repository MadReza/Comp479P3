http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/biology-phd.htmlThe doctoral program in biology is research-intensive with an emphasis on creativity and innovation. Guided by a research supervisor and committee members, students develop expertise and master modern research methodology while expanding their knowledge and analytical and critical thinking skills. Students also develop an in-depth understanding of current scientific literature and enhance communication skills.The main fields of research include cell biology, biochemistry, conservation biology, ecology and behavior, evolutionary biology, genomics, microbiology, molecular biology, plant biology, population genetics and proteomics.Concordia doctoral candidates have the opportunity to participate in a wide range of research projects funded through provincial and federal governmental agencies and industry.Top-notch research is supported by cutting-edge specialized equipment and facilities, including biochemical and molecular biology instrumentation, radioisotope laboratories, advanced microscopy and bioinformatics facilities, plant growth facilities and animal holding facilities.The Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics houses advanced facilities for genomics and proteomics research. The Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry offers students hands-on training in applications of mass spectrometry to diverse problems in biological chemistry.In addition, students will prepare themselves for a wide variety of careers in the life sciences.Requirements for the DegreeIf the examining committee judges that the proposal has weaknesses that can be corrected with minor revisions, it may suspend assigning a mark for a period not exceeding three months. The revised proposal then is assigned one of the three above grades.Admission Requirements. Applicants should have an MSc degree in life sciences and will be assessed by the departmental Graduate Studies Committee on the basis of undergraduate and graduate grades, letters of reference and research ability. Applicants should have at least a B average overall. Prior to final acceptance, the student must have a thesis supervisor chosen by mutual agreement among the student, the Graduate Studies Committee and the potential supervisor. Students will normally be accepted only for full-time study. Students with a Master’s degree from a foreign university will normally not be directly admitted into the PhD program, but will be accepted into the Master of/Magisteriate in Biology program. They will, however, on demonstration of the ability to complete a PhD, be eligible to transfer to a PhD as described below.Students registered in the Master of/Magisteriate in Science in Biology who demonstrate exceptional potential for independent research and have attained an A- average in graduate courses in the program may request to transfer to the PhD program during the first six months of the second year of enrolment. The transfer must be approved by the student’s supervisory committee and the departmental Graduate Studies Committee.Priority will be given to those who apply within the official deadlines listed above. Some programs may continue to accept applications after these deadlines. For more information, please contact the department.Sample classesCurriculumTo see curriculum requirements, please visit the section above on degree requirements. For course descriptions, please visit the Graduate Calendar. Main fields of research include biochemistry, biotechnology, cell biology, conservation biology, ecology and behaviour, evolutionary biology, genomics, microbiology, molecular biology, plant biology, population genetics and proteomics.The Department’s activities are supported by a number of specialized facilities including a greenhouse, animal holding facilities, epifluorescent and confocal microscopes, darkrooms, instrument rooms with centrifuges, spectrophotometers, basic biochemical instrumentation, a sterile transfer laboratory, cold rooms, environment controlled rooms and radioisotope laboratories.Major facilities include the Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics, the Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry and the Centre for Microscopy at Concordia (CMAC).For more information, visit our list of faculty members & their areas of expertise.Assistance is available for qualified candidates, on a competitive basis, in the form of teaching assistantships, university scholarships, fellowships, research grant stipends or bursaries, that provide a minimum of $15,000 a year.Please consult the School of Graduate Studies and the Financial Aid and Awards Office.
