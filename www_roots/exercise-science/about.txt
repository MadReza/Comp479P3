The inaugural event used a “Poster” format that provided students in the PhD and MSc programs a forum to present their original research to the academic and business communities. The participants’ posters and presentations were then judged by enthusiastic panels of Professors and Executives from Montreal’s business Community all of whom were hard-pressed to choose the winners for the best poster prizes as the calibre of the work displayed was so strong.

In her closing speech, Ulrike de Brentani stated that the event allowed JMSB to showcase two important, but less well-known research-based programs. It also provided the students with the unique opportunity to present and communicate their ideas and research findings, along with their real world implications, to members of the business community, for which the students were rewarded with invaluable feedback.

The enlightening event was organized by De Brentani, a professor in marketing and former director of the doctoral (PhD) and Master of Science (MSc) programs and Linda Dyer, chair of the the Department of Management.© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityAbout the AGREJohn Molson School of Business

As celebrated feminist Angela Davis plainly puts it, feminism is not only about women and not only about gender. It is a broader methodology that can enable us to better conceptualize and fight for progressive change.At the heart of our approach is the understanding that social inequality is produced through interlocking systems of oppression and that the State, nationalism and imperialism are central in producing and sustaining asymmetrical power relations such as those between men and women or those between people in the global north and those in the global south.We also consider the social production of identities and differences and critically examine media representations and consumer cultures.
The SdBI is a site for lively intellectual exchange where teaching, research, activism and community service are enriched by the presence of its members. This includes Since feminist scholarship insists on the connection between knowledge and action, the SdBI and the Women’s Studies Student Association (WSSA) are active in local feminist communities as well as in communities outside of Montreal and Quebec through research and outreach activities. SdBI professors are bilingual and the SdBI maintains close ties to UQAM’s Institut de recherches et d’études féministes (IREF), McGill University’s Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies (IGSF) and Université Laval’s Chaire Claire-Bonenfant Femmes, savoirs et sociétés. All of these organizations are part of the Réseau québécois d’études féministes (RéQEF), which promotes cooperation between feminists at our Institute and those at other universities in Quebec.
