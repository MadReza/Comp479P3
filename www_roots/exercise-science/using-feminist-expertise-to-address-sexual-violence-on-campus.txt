http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/sdbi/2016/02/16/using-feminist-expertise-to-address-sexual-violence-on-campus.htmlJoin us, a light lunch will be served!  We know sexual violence is a problem on university campuses across Canada, and we know that feminist approaches to sexual violence are best practice in the field. But can we bring the two together? Based on knowledge produced through collective activism and community-directed research, this talk will explore the tensions and points of connection between feminist expertise about sexual violence and its application inside of post-secondary institutions. In addition to outlining key challenges encountered in this work, Dr. Godderis will discuss innovative solutions that are currently being piloted at Laurier that connect the university with feminist organizations in the broader community. Dr. Rebecca Godderis is an Associate Professor of Community Health and graduate faculty in Social Justice and Community Engagement at Wilfrid Laurier University. She has been appointed to a three-year term as Gendered Violence Faculty Colleague working closely with senior leaders in the university to address sexual violence on campus© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
