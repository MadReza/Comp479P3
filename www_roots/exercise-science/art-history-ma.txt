http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/art-history/programs/graduate/art-history-ma.htmlEstablished in the early 1970s, the Master of Arts program in Art History focuses on the history and theory of visual and material culture in the North American context. The MA program was the first in Canada devoted to Canadian art, and it remains the centerpiece of our transcultural, interdisciplinary department.Faculty research expertise includes:The Department of Art History emphasises the cross-fertilisation of theory and scholarly practice and, in keeping with this approach, many of the MA seminars critically address the discipline of art history by means of recent developments in such fields as feminism and gender studies, postcolonial theory, cultural studies, and socio-political analysis. Students are thus exposed to a selection of strategies for research and analysis, and are encouraged to formulate approaches to art history based upon a mature awareness of the various possibilities open to them.For sample curriculum and course content, consult our MA seminars.The MA in Art History is a two-year degree, with coursework to be completed during the first year and the thesis to be written in the second.1. Credits
Students are required to take a minimum of 45 credits to complete the program: 21 credits of coursework and 24 credits for the thesis.2. Courses - 15 credits
Coursework consists of five seminars chosen from the Department's yearly seminar offerings. Exceptionally, with the approval of the graduate program director, students can register for one seminar (3 credits) in another discipline or at another university. Ideally, students will complete all coursework in their first three terms. Seminars are highly participatory and students are expected to partake in class discussions.3. Thesis Seminar (ARTH 655) - 3 credits
The thesis seminar is designed to introduce students to the intellectual and professional aspects of graduate school and academia, such as writing a thesis, conducting research, engaging with art historical theory and methodologies, giving a conference paper and applying for grants. Students attend this seminar during the first half of their first and second terms. Credit for this pass/fail seminar is accorded once the students have delivered their thesis presentations in the second year of the program (see below under "Thesis Presentation").4. Annotated Review of Sources and Documents (ARTH 654) - 3 credits
In addition to the 5 regular seminars, students take this individualized study course with their thesis supervisor, normally in the summer term following their first year of study. The course must be completed before students begin writing their thesis. Supervisor and students meet to determine the list of scholarly texts and/or archival materials to be addressed in order to strengthen the students' foundational knowledge of their designated research field and prepare them for writing the thesis. The students are responsible for a series of annotations, together with an essay that synthesizes the annotated material (total word count approximately 6,000 words).5. Thesis Proposal
The thesis proposal is written once the student has chosen a supervisor, and discussed the thesis topic with that professor. A thesis proposal should be 1 to 2 pages in length (double-spaced) and should also include a 1-page bibliography of primary and secondary sources and contacts, as appropriate. The proposal should consist of the following: a description of the topic, a statement of objectives, a description of methodology (including research strategies and intellectual framework), and the relation of the thesis to existing scholarship. Thesis proposals are submitted to the supervisor, and then to the department, for approval.6. Thesis Presentation
Once the student has begun researching and writing his/her thesis, an oral presentation of work-in-progress to students and faculty members in the program is required. Each presentation lasts 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute question period. This is the culmination of ARTH 655 (thesis seminar) and students will receive a Pass/Fail grade.7. Thesis - 24 credits
The MA thesis is a scholarly research essay, consisting of 10,000-12,000 words, with additional pages devoted to notes, bibliography, appendices and figures. The MA thesis should identify and develop a specific topic or case-study, and be situated in relation to existing debates and discussions within the discipline of art history and, as appropriate, in broader networks of intellectual exchange. The thesis is prepared under the supervision of a full-time professor who will examine the thesis along with two other scholars. While formal thesis submission is now done electronically, Art History students are asked to also submit a PDF version to the Department of Art History. Review the Thesis Preparation and Submission Guidelines. To peruse past MA Art History theses, visit Theses and Dissertations.8. Residency
The minimum residency requirement is three terms of full-time study, or the equivalent in part-time study.9. Language Requirement
Reading knowledge of English and French is mandatory. Students are assessed on the basis of a French language examination, where they are given a French text on the basis of which they are asked to answer questions.

Students whose first language is French may apply to the Department Assistant to have the examination waived.10. Timeline
