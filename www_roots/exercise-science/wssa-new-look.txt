The change follows years of debate about WSSA's graphic identity within the association. Specifically, many students felt that the previous logo, which included a stylized image of a dancing figure in a dress, was limiting. In response, WSSA took up the challenge to propose a logo that better reflects current feminisms and the SdBI student body.Commissioned by WSSA, the new logo was designed by Charline Bataille. Fresh, graphic and non-representational, it was an immediate hit with the students. Unconventionally, it also comes in a number of different color options. This playful characteristic is a nice reminder that the WSSA community unites a diversity of feminisms that stand together, even when they are at their most oppositional.In addition to a refreshed graphic look, WSSA has also announced a new website. Dynamic and easy to navigate, the platform is a student-dedicated space used to promote upcoming WSSA and SdBI events, as well as to share resources.
