http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/calendar/current/fasc/phys.htmlAdmission Requirements. The normal requirement for admission is a Master of Science degree in Physics with high standing from a recognized university. Meritorious students enrolled in the Master of Science program in Physics at this university who have completed all requirements except for the thesis may apply for permission to proceed directly to doctoral studies without submitting a master’s thesis.Requirements for the DegreeAcademic RegulationsTopAdmission Requirements. Applicants must have an honours degree, or its equivalent in Physics. Qualified applicants lacking prerequisite courses are required to take undergraduate courses (up to 12 credits) in addition to the regular graduate program. Applicants with deficiencies in their undergraduate preparation may be required to take a one-year qualifying program before admission to the MSc program.Requirements for the DegreeAcademic RegulationsCoursesAll courses are worth 3 credits each unless otherwise specified.
