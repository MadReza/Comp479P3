Location: EV3.309Serious game is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. Two case studies will be used to illustrate the opportunities and challenges of using game and game technologies for skills training and learning. The first case study shows how a virtual training platform may tackle the challenges raised by the requirements for a national competencies certification framework and the requirements of a new generation of trained water operators in Australia. The second case study presents a 3D virtual environment for psychology students to conduct experimental investigation for the testing and analysis of models and theories relating to operant conditioning. In the real world there are limited opportunities and various challenges for undergraduate students to be involved in experimental investigations. The use of a virtual environment will will allow students to explore a range of psychological phenomena without the need for close supervision required when dealing with human subjects.Dr. Carrie Lui is currently a Senior Lecturer of Information Technology at the School of Business at James Cook University.
