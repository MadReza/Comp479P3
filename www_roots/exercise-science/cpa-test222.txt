http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/graduate/cpa-test222.htmlConcordia University’s John Molson School of Business is pleased to announce that the application period is now open for our new Graduate Diploma in Chartered Professional Accountancy (CPA), which will begin in September 2014. JMSB enjoys a long and proud tradition of excellence in graduate accounting education and our dedicated instructors have years of audit, consulting and accounting experience.

Featured content here.e.g. from old site: "Our new CPA program will build on the successes of our CA program which always had an excellent first-time writer pass rate. The new graduate diploma will accommodate students with career objectives both within, and outside of, public accountancy, which will be determined by their choice of elective courses. Furthermore, credits obtained in the CPA program will be transferable to the John Molson MBA program, subject to some conditions."The Chartered Professional Accountancy (CPA) Order was created in May 2012 following the unification of the accounting profession in Quebec. It results from a merger of the Ordre des comptables agréés (CA), the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités (CGA) and the Ordre des comptables en management accrédités (CMA). The Order thus represents all the areas of expertise of the profession—assurance, financial accounting, management and management accounting, finances and taxation —at the service of enterprises, organizations and the public.

The CPA Order comprises over 36,000 members and 7,000 future CPAs. By combining its distinctive forces under a single order, the Quebec accounting profession strengthens its position both nationally and internationally.
