The AGRE showcases the latest research findings of JMSB’s Doctoral (PhD) and Master of Science (MSc) students. Participating students present their work on posters mounted throughout the Molson Building atrium.

The event is special in that graduate students are not often provided with an opportunity to present their research to the academic and business communities, representatives of which will be on hand to act as judges. Judges select the best posters at both the MSc and PhD levels and winners receive cash prizes.
The AGRE allows current students or recent graduates to discuss their ideas with interested parties and to receive feedback on their theses, thesis proposals or research-based seminars.

JMSB’s Associate Dean of Research and Research Programs Harjeet S. Bhabra says that in addition to showcasing the talent of PhD and MSc students, the AGRE also provides the university with the occasion to reconnect with alumni who return to serve as judges for the event. “I think the networking experience for our students, continued association with our alumni and the potential for recruiting top-ranked students to our program who get an early exposure to what academic research is all about is truly a win-win outcome for all."Best PosterGillian Leithman, Management
