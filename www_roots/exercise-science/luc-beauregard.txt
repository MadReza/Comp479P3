Thanks to the creation of the Luc Beauregard Centre of Excellence in Communications Research at the John Molson School of Business, students and academics will unite to advance knowledge in corporate and marketing communications. The Centre’s ultimate goal is to strengthen exchanges between industry and academia, better understand the role of communications in business and propel excellence in doctoral studies.
