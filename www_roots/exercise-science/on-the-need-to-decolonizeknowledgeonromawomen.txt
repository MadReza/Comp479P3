Both inside and outside the normative frameworks governing the development and transmission of knowledge, knowledge producers of Romani ethnicity, like the people to whom they belong, are profoundly hampered in three fundamental ethical credentials of being: the power to say, the power to act, the power to collect their own lives into a comprehensible and acceptable story. In this seminar, Dr. Carmona will use an intersectional and decolonial perspective to advance the understanding of another genealogy of ab-normativity built from the case study of historical knowledge about Romani women.Dr. Sarah Carmona, Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Manouba, Tunis © Concordia UniversityConcordia University
