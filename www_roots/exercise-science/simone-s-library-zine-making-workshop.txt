Interested in zines? Want to make your own? Simone’s Library is excited to collaborate with zine artist and illustrator Clara Bee Lavery in a zine making workshop. Whether you’ve never read a zine before or are a seasoned zine artist, this workshop is a great place to share skills and create! Snacks and zine making materials will be provided! However, feel free to bring whatever inspires you (drawings, photos etc).

Once you are done creating your zine, we will provide 5 free photocopies. With your consent, we’d love to add a copy of your zine to Simone’s Library's new Student Zine collection.

About the artist/facillitator:
Clara Bee Lavery is an illustrator, comics artist, and maker of both zines and mischief. She writes and draws about bodies, magic, and adventure. Clara Bee wants everyone to make art about their feelings. She blogs unreliably at clarabeelavery.com© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
