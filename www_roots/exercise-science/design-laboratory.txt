http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/info-systems-eng/facilities-services/research-labs/design-laboratory.htmlThe design tools being developed in the lab include design methodology and computer-assisted design software systems. The foundation of this development is the science of design, which provides scientific means for studying design activities. The design tools aim to help companies rapidly develop high quality new products.The focus of research in the design lab is Environment Based Design (EBD) methodology, which is the formalization of the recursive logic of design (Zeng and Cheng, 1991). This methodology supports the design process from the gathering of design requirements to the generation and evaluation of design solutions. It is based on an understanding of environment as the source of design problem (Zeng, 2004), which we have developed from the science of design (Zeng, 2002). Cognitive experiments are being conducted in the lab to validate its role in the innovative and creative design process.Design Laboratory:
