 Time: 10:30 a.m.
 
 Place: EV1.162This talk presents the results of a series of studies focused on three topics: what developers think about code smells, the interplay between code smells and different maintenance (programming-related) activities; and the relationships between code smells, refactorings and developers. In addition, the talk will present taxonomies for different phenomena within software development that can aid on the design of empirical studies on software evolution.Dr. Aiko Yamashita is Associate Professor at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Norway. Her research interest lies within empirical software engineering, in specific software quality and evolution. She is  also interested in studying human/organizational factors in computing.  Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversitySeminar by Dr. Aiko Yamashita (Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences)Department of Exercise Science
