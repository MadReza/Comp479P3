http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/admissions/undergraduate/apply/after.htmlOnce you pay and submit your application, you will receive a confirmation email with an attached PDF copy of your application. This email will include an eight-digit student ID number that you will use throughout your studies should you be accepted at Concordia. If you didn’t get the confirmation email (and you can’t find it in your junk mail folder either), call us at 514-848-2424, extension 2668 or email study@concordia.ca. We will send you your student ID number.You will receive a response anywhere from 48 hours for Cegep students to eight weeks or more for international students. Because the admissions process varies for each student and program, we cannot give specific dates for a decision.If you apply for admission to a semester in the distant future (for example, to start a year from the time you apply), we will make a decision once we receive the grades for any courses that you have not yet completed.If we require further supporting documents, we’ll contact you to request that you upload electronic copies online. Sign into MyConcordia and go to My Student Centre. Find the “To Do List” on the right hand side of the screen. Click Upload Document. Choose the type of document you’d like to upload. (You don’t need to upload all the documents listed in the drop-down list, only the documents required to support your application.)File types that can be uploaded include:Files can be up to 5 MB each.Once you submit a required document, we will review your file again and remove that item from your “To Do List”. Please note that it may take up to 15 working days to update your file. You won’t be able to see the documents you’ve already uploaded – you will only be able to see the documents you still need to upload. Please do not upload a document more than once.You can keep tabs on your application status online. Log into MyConcordia.ca and go to My Student Centre.If you can see through My Student Centre that you have been admitted, congratulations! Your official offer letter will follow. If you’re wondering where your letter is, please don’t worry: due to system changes, we are experiencing some delays. Your offer should arrive by email before too long. We communicate admission decisions to you by email or regular post – not over the phone.
