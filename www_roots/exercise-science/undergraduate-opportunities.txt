The goal of the awards is to stimulate interest in research, participatory research, or research-creation work that will complement undergraduate coursework and enhance preparation for graduate studies or research-related careers.The NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards, funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, are meant to stimulate interest in research in the natural sciences and engineering. The awards are meant to encourage students to undertake graduate studies and pursue a research career in these fields. If you would like to gain research work experience that complements your studies in an academic setting, these awards can provide you with financial support (through Concordia).The Northern Scientific Training Program (NSTP) is a student research and training opportunity which is open to senior undergraduate and graduate students "who have specialized in some aspect of northern scientific studies and who have northern research experience." In order for a student to be eligible they are required to have a supervisor who is a funded Concordia researcher. The NSTP "supports projects that lie north of the southern limit of the discontinuous permafrost zone, with the addition of all of the Southern Yukon in the West; that section of Labrador south to and including Red Bay; and the other seven Arctic countries (Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the U.S.A. - Alaska).The Concordia Institute of Aerospace Design and Innovation (CIADI), founded in 2001, was conceived to promote awareness and provide leading edge know-how among engineering students engaged in aerospace design and innovation. In order to enhance and complement the education of undergraduate students, the Institute conducts collaborative industry-driven design and research projects of 500 to 1000 hours per year.CIADI students are selected from among the top undergraduate students in ENCS and are supervised by aerospace industry engineers as well as Concordia professors. Through internship programs, organised visits, tours and special training courses the unit provides an introduction of the aerospace industry to the students and the students to the aerospace industry, thus helping graduating students to find employment and industry to find well qualified recruits.
