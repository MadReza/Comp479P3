For his exhibition 'MTL Nord', Victor Arroyo used counter-surveillance video to reflect on relationships between identity, site, history, and memory. Arroyo’s work seeks to challenge institutional power asymmetries in documentary practices at the intersection of everyday life, site-specific issues of social justice, and political oppression.Natalie Nadeau's exhibition 'Chip Production' deconstructs manufacturing processes, emulating that of tool die or auto part production, and gives significance to the waste that is created during these processes. It aims to illustrate the kind of elegance and seduction that material refuse can take on as it reveals the finished product. A romanticized observation of the factory worker is portrayed through the bronze casted work gloves. The work is an homage to the materiality of mass production while recognizing the importance of the hand of a worker within these ultra-mechanical environments. © Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityFaculty of Fine Arts
