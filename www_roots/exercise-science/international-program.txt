http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/calendar/current/international-program.htmlConcordia International is the gateway to most international activities at Concordia University. Operating under the Associate Vice-President International, CI is one of the four constituent units of the Office of the Vice-President Research and Graduate Studies. The Office supports Concordia University’s internationalisation policy through a variety of programs and projects for students and faculty both on campus and abroad. Each year, many Concordia students, faculty and staff participate in a variety of international activities such as study abroad programs, collaborative curriculum development and joint research projects. These initiatives are reflective of an increasingly global academic world and are of great assistance in helping Concordia’s reputation grow beyond its borders.© Concordia UniversityConcordia University
