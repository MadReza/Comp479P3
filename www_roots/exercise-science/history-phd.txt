http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/academics/graduate/history-phd.htmlOur PhD program trains inquisitive minds for the 21st century.  The department’s mission is both to prepare historians for careers in teaching and research and produce graduates who share its commitment to serving the broader community. The PhD in History provides an academically rich and collaborative learning environment where you are encouraged to aim for both breadth and depth of your studies.  Work alongside distinguished faculty members who specialize in a broad range of temporal and thematic fields including law and society, gender and sexuality, war and peace, science and the environment, public history and memory, media and popular culture, genocide and human rights, and transnationalism and empire.Doctoral students enter a vibrant research community and are invited to attend the many workshops and guest lectures hosted by the department or become involved in one of the internationally renowned research centres that are affiliated with the Department of History:Our doctoral students have been published in a multitude of prestigious journals and essay collections, including Labour/Le Travail, the Journal of Global History and La Grande Guerre: Une histoire culturelle.Requirements for the DegreeComprehensive Examinations. (12 credits). Early in their first term in the program, and in consultation with the GPD, new PhD students form an advisory committee of three faculty members to assist in the selection and preparation of comprehensive fields. In the first year of their program, students take reading courses with the supervisors of each of the three fields, which prepares the students to complete the full requirements of each field's preparation over the following terms.Subject to the availability of appropriate faculty members, the Department of History is normally prepared to supervise comprehensive examinations in a range of broadly defined geographical and chronologically limited fields, as well as in thematic fields, as suits the student's program.  Example of fields recently supervised include:  History of Canada since 1867; History of France since 1789; History of Haiti from 1801 to 1986; Labour History.  For other fields available, applicants may consult the faculty research pages of the department's website.The major field will be that in which the student’s proposed doctoral thesis falls. Normally students choose at least one field defined in specific geographical terms.Any student may offer one examination in a related discipline when approved by the History Graduate Committee and by the appropriate faculty member and/or program administrator in that discipline.The preparation of a comprehensive field should give students sufficient background to teach at an introductory level and/or do advanced research in the field. Although the requirements may vary from one field to the next, a core reading list of 50 to 100 titles per field is suggested as reasonable. The reading list for a field is be drawn up by the professor in consultation with the student in the context of the reading courses associated with the field taken in the student's first year, and once established, both must agree to any significant changes.PhD Thesis Proposal Preparation and Colloquium. HIST 885: PhD Thesis Proposal and Colloquium (6 credits). Following the successful completion of the comprehensive exams, students prepare a written thesis proposal for the approval of the internal members of their thesis committee. The thesis proposal should describe and justify the intended topic, explain its place in the historiography of the field, discuss the intended research methods, and identify the source requirements including their availability. Students are normally expected to submit and defend their thesis proposal by the end of the fifth term of their studies. When the written proposal is approved the student presents an oral colloquium about the proposal to the department. When the proposal and colloquium requirements are satisfied, the student is admitted to candidacy.TopAdmission Requirements.
