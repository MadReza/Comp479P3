http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/finearts/art-history/programs/graduate/art-history-ma/seminars/arth-648.htmlCraft is shaped by its perception as accessible, often preoccupied with skill, labour, the ordinary, the everyday, the repetitive, the functional, the decorative, the mundane, among others. This graduate seminar will explore the problematic of exhibiting such objects and practices within museums or other institutional frameworks.  

Using recent examples of craft exhibitions, we will examine issues relevant to contemporary museum practice, curatorial issues of exhibition and display and the relation between collecting practice and the history of art. A series of case studies will inform the weekly seminar discussions, such as the Museum of Arts and Design’s 2011 shows Global Africa Project and Crafting Modernism (2011), as well as the 2016 In Time (the Rhythm of the Workshop); the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Out of the Ordinary: Spectacular Craft (2008) and Disobedient Objects (2014-15); the British touring show Radical Craft: Alternative Ways of Making (2016); the Textile Museum of Canada’s She Will Always Be Younger Than Us (2009) and Home Economics (2016); Super String (curated by Anthea Black for Stride Gallery, Calgary, 2006); On the Table: 100 years of Functional Ceramics in Canada (Gardiner Museum, 2007); and Gestures of Resistance (Museum of Contemporary Craft, Portland, 2011).

Students will be expected to engage with this material through readings, discussions, exhibition visits, primary and archival research. As the final project for this seminar, it is anticipated that students will address the material from the course by developing a substantive exhibition concept for select craft practices and/or objects, including a detailed written curatorial strategy for the display of craft grounded in their seminar learning.
