This year, Quebec art therapists are uniting under the theme of how creative expression promotes well-being. This theme evokes the needs of the body, spirit and heart. Experiencing, tasting and feeling one’s well-being will occur in a creative space where gestures, movements, sounds, colours and words meet and come to life. Art therapists in Quebec use an artistic and therapeutic approach to bring out the full potential of individuals or groups.

Join us to experience various art forms: visual arts, dance, movement, drama and music.
