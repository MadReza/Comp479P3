It’s time to hunker down and hit the books for back to school!Luckily, Concordia has a varied array of study spaces to choose from when you need to mix it up.A perfect oasis from Montreal’s winter, the Concordia greenhouse has several tables set up for studying.Enjoy the fresh atmosphere and make yourself a cup of tea — there’s a kettle available for boiling water — as you catch up on your reading or put the finishing touches on a paper amid the greenery.Located on the 13th floor of the Henry F. Hall (H) Building, the greenhouse is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.
 Not into plants? The Hall Building has a few other study locations to choose from. Why not grab a seat in the mezzanine on the second floor, near the Hive Café?If there’s no room, venture up to one of the lounges located on floors 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12. Both of these locales are great for people-watching in between chapters.The Hall Building also boasts two computer labs (H-923 and H-980) that are available for students with active status from 8 a.m. to 9:45 p.m., as long as the labs aren't reserved for a class. 
 Whether you’re a business student or not, the John Molson (MB) Building has open spaces for studying on floors 2 through 6.The big windows show off Montreal’s cityscape, and if you’re lucky, you’ll grab one of two seats available on the 15th floor for an even more incredible view.
 If you need silence to concentrate, the Grey Nuns (GN) Reading Room is for you.Just a five-minute walk from the R. Howard Webster Library, the beautiful and newly renovated space operates on a strict no-talking rule, so it’s an ideal place to get down to business. The Reading Room seats 192, but you can also reserve one of 14 group study rooms.The Reading Room and group study rooms are open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. through Monday to Thursday, and until 6 p.m. on Fridays. It’s open on weekends as well from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Are you someone who fills up on snacks and coffee or tea while studying? If you want to be close to a source of healthy and affordable food and drink, then set up shop in one of Concordia’s two Café X locations.The larger of the two student-run cafés is on the second floor of the Visual Arts (VA) Building and houses Gallery X, where you can get inspiration from Concordian art.The other location is on the seventh floor of the Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV).
 Studying on the Loyola Campus? Drop by the inclusive Loyola Chapel. When it’s not being used for an event, the chapel offers a unique study setting of historical architecture and stained glass.The Webster Library is undergoing a major transformation that will finish in 2017. Phase 1 and 2 improvements already accessible to you include, among many others, five enclosed reading rooms, eight group-study rooms, collaborative space and a Friends of the Library zero-noise room. For graduate students, this phase delivered three silent dissertation writers’ rooms, shelving and lockers to store belongings, and a lounge to help break the sense of isolation experienced during marathon writing and research sessions.In total: 1,000 new study spaces.
 If you’re committed to studying in a library but are looking for a change of scenery, or if your classes are on the Loyola Campus, don’t forget about the Vanier Library.It seats more than 700 and is open 24 hours a day. Concordia ID cards are required to enter the library between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.
 On top of providing career counselling and resources, the Career Resource Centre (CRC) welcomes students to make use of its computer workstations and small study space.The CRC is on the fourth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building (H-440) and is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.
 Sometimes a change in location may not be enough to jump-start your studies.Concordia has two Student Success Centres, one on each campus (SGW Campus: Room H-481. Loyola Campus: Room AD-101), which offer a wide range of support to students, including educational counselling and student mentors. Open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
