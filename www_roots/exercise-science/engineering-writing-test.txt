Part Two of the EWT 
This information is quoted from the EWT web site.
In this section, [Part Two], you will be asked to interpret and write about data presented in the form of a pie chart, bar graph, line graph or diagram. You will be asked to answer several questions about the data with two or three sentences each. To prepare for this section, find a bar graph or pie chart in a newspaper, magazine or on the Internet. Consider what information is provided by the graph. To whom is this graph important and why? What conclusions can be drawn from the graph? What trends does it demonstrate? What kind of decisions might be made on the basis of the information contained in the graph?
