You MUST complete the self-assessment, at least 3 business days before your scheduled MAP to Success orientation session.If you do not receive this email please contact us at success@concordia.ca to request the instructions.During the MAP to Success orientation session, an educational counsellor will provide you with a detailed, printed report of your MAP to success results. The counsellor will also help you interpret those results and create a personal action plan. Student Success Mentor Office
