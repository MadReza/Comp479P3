Metal bars inserted as a “bone substitute” to promote healing can end up causing infection or rejection by the body. Ehsan Rezabeigi is working on a lightweight implant made of glass and polymer foam that’s both porous enough and strong enough to mimic the bone itself. His “bone scaffold” will safely dissolve into the body once it’s no longer needed.Why Concordia was the right choice for him: “The working environment has a big impact on what you do. For me, it’s been perfect: modern labs, the best equipment, and supervisors who offer just the right balance of pushing you and encouraging you to work independently.”© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityEhsan RezabeigiJoin the ConversationRelated LinksMechanical Engineering
