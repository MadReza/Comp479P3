That’s the message the new Concordia Stingers brand, logo and uniforms will convey to their fans as well as their rivals.  It’s a bold departure while remaining true to the spirit and tradition of varsity sports on campus.The new logo retains the traditional yellow and burgundy colors - respecting the history and influence of the university’s two founding institutions, Loyola College and Sir George Williams University - complete with stripes and a stinger.  All the varsity teams will sport new uniforms starting with the opening games of their respective seasons.The new look was developed following extensive consultation with students, coaches, athletes, alumni and staff. With the goal of uniting the community, a multidisciplinary team was pulled together consisting of 20 students who prepared scripts to be used in videos, publications and on the university’s multimedia platforms.Media Kit: Concordia University Unveils New Look for its Varsity Sports TeamsDossier de presse: L’Université Concordia révèle la nouvelle allure de ses équipes sportives interuniversitaires© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityMedia kit: Concordia's new look for varsity sportsNews
