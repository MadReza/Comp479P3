Qualified applicants requiring prerequisite courses may be asked to take such courses in addition to their regular graduate program. The Faculty Graduate Studies Committee, in consultation with the Institute, is responsible for the recommendation of all applications for admission.Residence requirements. The minimum residence requirement for the Master’s degree is three terms (one year) of full-time study, or the equivalent in part-time study.Transfer from the Master of Engineering in Information Systems Security. Students, in good standing, who have completed a minimum of 12 credits in the Master of Engineering in Information Systems Security, may apply for a transfer to the Master of Applied Science in Information Systems Security.Degree requirementsThe requirements described here are in addition to the general degree requirements for the Master’s programs in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.In order to graduate, students must have a CGPA of at least 3.00.Courses. Students must complete a minimum of 20 credits, including 16 credits of core courses (INSE 6110, INSE 6120, INSE 6130, and INSE 6140) and one 4-credit course as shown below:Students have the option to do the thesis work within the industrial milieu through the Institute for Co-operative Education. The suggested schedule of the program is as follows: fall and winter terms will be dedicated to course work, followed by two or three terms for research and development in industry, culminating in one or two terms in the Institute for the writing and defence of the thesis. Each student in this case will have a supervisor from the Institute and a mentor from industry. The intellectual property will be managed according to the University policy.TopAdmission RequirementsApplicants to the Master of/Magisteriate in Engineering in Information Systems Security must hold a bachelor’s degree or equivalent in:Admission to the program is competitive and only applicants with high academic standing will be considered.
