And while there are lots of ways to cope, is there anything more comforting than the company of a furry, friendly animal?From December 2 to 8 the Vanier Library, on the Loyola Campus, and the Webster Library downtown are welcoming several pet-therapy dogs from the Blue Ribbon Canine Centre. They’ll be on hand to help students de-stress.The visits at the Vanier Library take place from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 2, and Monday, December 7, outside of Room VL-101.  The Webster Library visits take place from noon to 2:00 p.m. on Thursday, December 3, and Tuesday, December 8, in the atrium area near the Course Reserve Room, LB-201.Similar sessions have been used successfully at McGill University; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the University of Wisconsin; and Yale University to help reduce anxiety and lift moods.Among the canines on hand for the session will be Brandy, a Shetland sheepdog.Along with her fellow pet-therapy dogs, Brandy will be waiting for you in the library. Brandy has met many people during her eight-year career, and is a proud founding member of Blue Ribbon Therapy Dogs.As a performance dog who has participated in many dog-sport trials, she understands the pressure of exams.  She looks forward to her visit to Concordia, and hopes to brighten everyone's day.
