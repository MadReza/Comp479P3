http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/sdbi/student-life/advising-resources.htmlNew students must meet with an academic advisor before they can register for their courses. Academic advising is done by appointment.Returning students can also make appointments if they have any questions about their programs, are unsure what courses they still need to take, or want to make sure that they are on the right track. Alternatively, students can send their questions by e-mail to Linda Bowes.To do a change of concentration (e.g. to change into the Women's Studies program or to add the Major or Minor in Women's Studies) just send an e-mail to Linda Bowes (don't forget to include your Student I.D.) clearly stating what program should be changed in what way.Please contact Linda Bowes, the Women's Studies academic advisor, to make an appointment (don't forget to include your Student I.D.).514-848-2424 ext. 2370linda.bowes@concordia.ca© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityAdvising and resourcesSimone de Beauvoir Institute
