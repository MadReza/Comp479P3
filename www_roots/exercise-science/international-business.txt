http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/co-op/international-business.htmlInternational Business Co-op program offers exposure to several disciplines including international management, marketing, finance, as well as international aspects of politics, economics, and sociology. Students benefit from the program’s practical orientation toward the international trade in goods and services, dealing with the challenges of a complex multicultural and multilingual marketplace, and exposure to the managerial challenges of operating within a complex globally competitive environment and legal implications of dealing with different legal jurisdictions.
“I gained useful insight on important processes and subtleties within an international company.  My goal was to learn as much as possible for my own benefit while functioning efficiently and making myself useful to the employer.  That means I had to compromise, be patient and understanding of their needs.  On the other hand I had to be alert and inquisitive, always on the lookout for opportunities to engage myself in international business tasks as well as asking the appropriate questions.  The Sun Life Financial environment as a whole is a great setting for career growth and development for any possible concentration. I found my experience very rewarding.”
