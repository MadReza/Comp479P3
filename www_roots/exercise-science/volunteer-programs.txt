As a volunteer you will learn about writing resumes and cover letters, preparing for interviews, conducting effective job search strategies, and negotiating job offers, as well as, gain valuable insights to networking and business etiquette tips.Through an interactive training program, you will be introduced to career management processes and then embark on delivering 3-5 introductory career management workshops per week, preparing JMSB students to meet with their Career Advisor. Additionally, the program offers a great opportunity to gain networking, public speaking, promotional and event management experience. You will not only have the opportunity to network with JMSB students, alumni and employers; you will assist with the management of employer events that are hosted both on and off campus. CMS volunteers are considered a highly integral part of the Career Management Services (CMS) team and we look forward to meeting you.If you are seeking a fantastic opportunity to gain extensive knowledge on the recruitment and job search processes, as well as, a chance to give back to the JMSB community, we look forward to receiving your application.To apply, please send your cover letter amd resume to cmsvolunteer.jmsb@concordia.ca Attend a career eventShare your success storyContact us© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityVolunteer ProgramJohn Molson School of Business
