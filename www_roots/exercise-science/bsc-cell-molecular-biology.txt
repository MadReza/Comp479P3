When you study Cell and Molecular Biology, you get a front-row seat to study the basic processes that run life’s playbook. As a cell and molecular biologist, you can discover how genes shape organisms, how immune cells protect our body and how biotechnology can develop pest- or drought-resistant crops for the developing world.Our Biology Department laboratories feature modern equipment and protocols that introduce you to state-of-the-art technologies for cell physiology and molecular biology. Small class sizes foster strong student-professor relationships. As a Cell and Molecular Biology student, you'll follow both the biology core curriculum and courses focused within your specialization. Through labs, lectures and tutorials you will:Concordia’s hands-on approach provides a solid foundation for a career in the life and health sciences or paves the way for future graduate studies.A Bachelor of Science degree takes a minimum of three or four years (90 – 120 credits) of full-time study, depending on your academic background.Options:Degree requirementsMinimum cut-off averages should be used as indicators. The cut-off data may change depending on the applicant pool. Applicants who meet the stated minimum requirements are not guaranteed admission to these programs.Make sure you also meet Concordia’s minimum admission requirements.We consider complete applications year round and we give priority to applicants who apply by official deadlines. Late applications will be considered if places are still available for the fall term only.We reserve the right to close admission to a program at any time after the official deadline without prior notice.
