http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/students/sas/undergrad-program-info/course-sequences/mature-entry.htmlPlease note that ECP and MEP students should complete any deficiencies in their first year of study, prior to following the regular program.An example of a first year schedule for an ECP/MEP student could be:First Semester:Second Semester:* ECP and MEP students must also complete 6 credits of social science and humanities electives. These Social Science or Humanities electives must be chosen from section 71.20.1 of the Undergraduate student calendar. This may be done at your discretion (e.g., summer or adding additional credits on to a term). Please note that ESL courses and other courses that focus on the acquisition of a language may not be used to meet this requirement.If you have already been awarded an exemption for a course you do not need to repeat it. Should you need any assistance in selecting courses, please do not hesitate to contact Student Academic Services for futher assistance.Since these courses are not scheduled by the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, you may have course conflicts.After you have completed the credits for your first year, please follow the course sequence for your program.Part-time students should take the evening courses specified below for the current year.Students wishing to work at a somewhat faster pace should consult their departmental Advisor or Student Academic Services for advice on course selection. The maximum load per term for part-time students is eleven (11) credits. Upon completion of all 200-level courses, it is strongly recommended that students studying part-time consider transferring to full-time status, to allow them to complete 12-15 credits per term.Students accepted to the ECP or MEP program who study on a full-time basis will normally complete their degree after five years (10 terms) of study. Extended Credit and Mature Entry students are required to complete all prerequisites before commencing the regular Engineering sequence in their department.Please review the mature entry extended credit first year course sequence for engineering students or computer science students.An option is a grouping of courses within an Engineering program that allows you to obtain more in depth knowledge in a particular field. Courses in the option are usually taken in your last year or two of studies. For example, in Computer Engineering students may choose from System Hardware Option or System Software Option. Students in Mechanical Engineering may choose from options in Thermo Fluid and Propulsion, Design and Manufacturing, Mechatronics and Control Systems or Aerospace and Vehicle systems.Options are declared within a student’s department, usually in their third year of study. In the case of students in Electrical and Computer Engineering however options are declared at the end of a student’s first year. To find out more about the options available in your program and when your option should be declared, please consult the program descriptions.Student Academic Services
