http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/offices/garnet-key.htmlThe Garnet Key is a voluntary group that is sponsored by the President of the University and serves as one of the key elements in promoting a positive image of Concordia University. Garnet Key is more than a society. It is a representative group of Concordia students who hold high academic standing and who are involved in activities both within and outside the university. -Henry F.
