http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/jmsb/programs/co-op/human-resource-management.htmlThe Co-op program in Human Resource Management integrates the academic requirements of the BComm with paid working experience in the HRM field. This helps the student with career management and well as networking with professionals in the work force. The student is exposed to different sized organizations from non-for-profits, to medium and large international companies. 
"When I first enrolled in the JMSB Co-op program, I wasn't really sure what to expect. Where will I work? Am I ready to face the real world? Have I chosen the right career path? Needless to say that all my questions were answered the moment I was presented with incredible opportunities and valuable tools to drive me to succeed both academically and professionally. Co-op not only gave me professional exposure to several different industries and work structures, it allowed me to apply the knowledge that I had acquired from my studies into a professional context. Also, my internships allowed me to build and maintain solid professional relationships with different business executives that inspired and mentored me as a student.

Today, as a Staffing Specialist for PepsiCo Beverages Canada, I cannot stress how crucial internships are in preparing students for the reality of various business sectors. I firmly believe that I would not be where I am today had it not been for JMSB’s Co-op program."
