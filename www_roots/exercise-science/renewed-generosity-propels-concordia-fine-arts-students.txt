The grad’s affinity motivated her to support the next generation of photographers with a $200,000 gift.The new Lande Award in Photography will support one graduate student per year at the university’s Faculty of Fine Arts.

She established the Mildred Lande and Margot Lande Graduate Scholarship in Photography with her mother in 2000.“We are honoured by Margot Lande’s support. It’s a pleasure to welcome her back,” said Marcel Dupuis, associate vice-president of development at Concordia’s Advancement and Alumni Relations.“It’s always a pleasure to see a Concordia graduate give back to their university,” said Rebecca Duclos, dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts. “Steadfastness and generosity have characterized Margot’s commitment to our university.”The first recipient of the Lande Award in Photography is graduate student Matthew Brooks, BFA 16. He said the gift will prove a turning point for those who receive it.“Behind every great art student is a group of people,” said Brooks. “Without support, we couldn’t navigate the particularities of this profession.”Search for an expert to comment on any topicEnter a phrase or keyword© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityRenewed generosity propels Concordia fine arts studentsFaculty of Fine Arts
