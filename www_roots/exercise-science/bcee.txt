When PhD program profiles of individual students in Building Engineering extend into related fields such as computer science, economics, mathematics, sociology, etc., the students are required to take appropriate courses outside the Department.Master’s Programs in Building EngineeringThe Department offers two 45-credit programs leading to the MASc or MEng degrees with specialization in one of the following four branches:Applicants lacking the appropriate engineering background will be required to enrol in an extended program of specified courses. These courses are in addition to the regular 45-credit program.Requirements for the DegreeThe requirements described here are in addition to the general degree requirements for the Master’s programs in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.TopStudents must complete 45 credits as shown below.TopStudents must complete 45 credits of 6000 or 7000 level courses. The courses must be selected as follows:A minimum of 21 credits chosen from one of the Course Groups in List A. This set of courses may also include the project and seminar courses ENGR 6991, BCEE 6961 or the industrial training course ENCS 6931.List A: Course Groups in Building Engineering ProgramGroup 1 - Building Environment: BLDG 6611** plus courses in the Topic Areas: E07, E21, E23.Group 2 - Building Science: BLDG 6611** plus courses in the Topic Areas: E21, E22.Group 3 - Building Structures: Topic Areas: E06, E21, E31.Group 4 - Construction Management: Topic Areas: E21, and E24.** Students who completed the undergraduate equivalent of BLDG 6611 must replace it by a course to be approved by the Graduate Program Director.TopAdmission requirementsApplicants to a certificate must hold a bachelor’s degree in engineering or architecture or equivalent with an above-average standing. The Department will recommend on the acceptability of an applicant for admission to the program and may require the applicant to do specific remedial course work to meet the program requirements.Requirements for completionThe program can be completed in one to three years. Students with high standing in their bachelor program and whose academic records satisfy the requirements for good standing in the Master’s Program in Building Engineering may apply for transfer to the Master’s program.CoursesBuilding Science.
