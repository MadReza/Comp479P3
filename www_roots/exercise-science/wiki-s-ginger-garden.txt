http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/events/artsci/sdbi/2015/08/27/wiki-s-ginger-garden.htmlWiki’s Ginger Garden, now in it's third edition, facilitates serendipity by celebrating accidental discoveries and fortunate happenstance. The event takes the form of an intimate public potluck gathering, a causal moment to eat, drink, and talk about burning questions and current projects in arts, education, and community. Capturing imaginations, it is also a space for sharing and exchanging information and ideas. Concretely, ten presenters who self-identify as Asians/ mixed race will present their most recent work in 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes for Q & A. The event also includes open time for public announcements, questions, spontaneous presenters, and discussion. Presentations are video documented (with permission) and archived on the Asian Canadian Wiki, a website is a database of all things Asian Canadian.

Advocating and advancing self representation, the Asian Canadian Wiki team is dedicated to working to end all forms of discrimination, including racism and stereotyping. In the context of this event, "Asian" includes people of mixed race whose ancestors come from countries on the continent of Asia. All are welcome!!!!
