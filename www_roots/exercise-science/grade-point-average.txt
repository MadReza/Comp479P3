http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/encs/students/sas/undergrad-program-info/grade-point-average.htmlGrading SystemAt the end of each course, the instructor will submit a letter grade for every student registered. Using the grade point equivalents listed below, Grade Point Averages (GPA) are calculated for the evaluation of academic achievement, Honours standing, prizes, and academic standing.NOTE: Although a "C-" grade is designated as Satisfactory, a weighted grade point average of at least 2.00 for the assessment period is required for acceptable standing in the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science.An Annual Weighted Grade Point Average (WGPA) for each student is calculated at the end of each academic year (including the Summer, Fall and Winter terms), provided that the student has attempted a minimum of 12 credits. If the student has attempted fewer than 12 credits, these credits will be included in the assessment for the following academic year.When a student transfers from one degree or certificate to another degree or certificate, the WGPA is calculated only for courses recorded in the current degree or certificate. Special regulations for graduating students may be specified in each Faculty's regulations. Grades for supplemental and replacement examinations and for late completion of courses with "INC" or "MED" notations are included in the assessment period in which they are recorded. In the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, prerequisite courses required for admission to a program will not be counted unless they are specifically listed on the student's acceptance letter.A WGPA of at least 1.50 but less than 2.00 for the assessment period. Students in conditional standing may proceed subject to the following conditions:Failure to meet the criteria for acceptable or conditional standing, or conditional standing over two consecutive assessments. Failed Standing: Failure to meet the criteria for acceptable or conditional standing, or conditional standing over two consecutive assesments. Failed students may apply for readmission through the Dean's Office-Student Affairs. If readmitted, they will be placed on academic probation.Find out more about applying for readmission following failed standing.Student Academic Services
