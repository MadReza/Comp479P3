And now there's video proof!The Rocketry Division team placed second, behind Oregon State University, in the Space Dynamics Laboratory Payload Challenge at the 10th Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition.The 10-foot airframe, or outer structure, was "by far the most advanced frame presented at the competition," according to mechanical engineering student Neil Woodcock, Space Concordia's president and chief rocket designer.
 
Woodcock highlighted the help of Suong Hoa, director of the Concordia Center for Composites, who offered the use of his lab for its construction. FundOne, Concordia's alumni crowdfunding program, also provided support.June's event was hosted by the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association, which seeks to further the field of experimental sounding rocketry. It defines this as "roughly between 'experimental' or 'research' high-power rockets and sounding rockets capable of reaching space (generally defined as 100 km altitude)."
