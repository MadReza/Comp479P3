http://www.concordia.ca/content/concordia/en/artsci/academics/interdisciplinary/hellenic-studies-unit.htmlThe Hellenic Studies Unit was established by a committee of professors, students, and staff. In the past two decades three important events took place at Concordia that brought forth the need for its creation.Responding to these developments, the University's professors of Hellenic descent decided to support and formalize these events. A committee of professors, students, and staff was formed and established the foundation for the development of the Hellenic Studies Unit, under the auspices of the Faculty of Arts and Science, and in close collaboration with the Department of Classics, Modern Languages and Linguistics and the Center for International Academic Cooperation.The Hellenic Studies Unit and the Hellenic Community offer scholarships and bursaries for students enrolled in courses in the Hellenic Studies elective group. For more information, please consult the list of academic activities for the current year.Althought the unit operates as an autonomous entity within the University, it is an academic unit under the auspices of the Faculty of Arts and Science. The Unit is connected with all other Faculties, departments and programs of the University and is headed by a Coordinator who is appointed by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science.Each of these books can be ordered from the Hellenic Studies Unit for $20.
