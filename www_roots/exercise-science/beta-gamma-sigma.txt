This year's Beta Gamma Sigma inductees from Concordia's John Molson School of Business have certainly earned that title.

Concordia University's John Molson School of Business congratulates the students who have earned invitations to join the distinct organization. While almost 300,000 students receive bachelors or masters degrees in business each year, only about 20,000 are inducted into lifetime membership in Beta Gamma Sigma. Only students who rank in the top five percent of the junior class, the top 10 percent of the senior class and the top 20 percent of the PhD, Master's and Graduate Diploma programs at schools accredited by AACSB International - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business - are eligible for an invitation to membership.Beta Gamma Sigma was founded as a national organization in 1913. Its mission is to encourage and honour academic achievement and personal excellence in the study and practice of business. The Society endeavours to foster in its members an enduring commitment to the principles and values of Beta Gamma Sigma: honour and integrity, pursuit of wisdom and earnestness.Beta Gamma Sigma membership has become a truly international honour. With the expansion of accreditation by AACSB International, membership is no longer limited to those who have studied in the U.S. or Canada. These outstanding Concordia students are now eligible for the highest recognition a business student anywhere in the world can receive in an undergraduate or masters program at a school accredited by AACSB International.Â© Concordia UniversityConcordia UniversityBeta Gamma SigmaJohn Molson School of Business
