http://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/news/offices/vpaer/aar/2016/09/19/sharing-community.htmlConcordia is home to more than 46,000 students who can choose from about 500 degree programs and 7,000 courses. Ensuring that the necessary resources are available to allow the students to succeed takes significant financial support.To that end, in 2015-16 the university raised $18.7 million from its generous supporters — including alumni — for students, libraries, research, academic programs and other projects, and university activities.Those funds included over $2.1 million from the Community Campaign, Concordia’s annual fundraising campaign. Concordia’s internal community of faculty, staff, retirees and members of the Board of Governors donated in excess of $283,000 to the 2015-16 Community Campaign.In addition, more than $70,000 for scholarships and bursaries arrived from contributions to the Shuffle, Concordia’s annual 6.5-km walkathon from the Sir George Williams to Loyola campuses. Internal community members contribute to the university in a variety of other ways, such as through the Concordia Used Book Fair, which in its two decades has raised more than $150,000 for Concordia student scholarships and the Multi-faith and Spirituality Centre’s Student Emergency and Food Fund.The internal support serves as a role model for the larger community of donors.Concordia Centraide Campaign
